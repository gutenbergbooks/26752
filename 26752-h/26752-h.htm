<p>Several few typographical errors have been corrected. They
appear in the text <span class="correction" title="explanation will pop up">like this</span>, and the

In the original, 20 pages were printed with out-of-sequence page numbers, the numbers as printed being repeated in the index. These
have been retained as printed but marked with an asterisk to distinguish them from the in-sequence pages which
have the same number, thus 249*
</p><p>
Mixed fractions have been consistently transcribed as e.g. 5.5/96 although the period is not always present in the printed text (this
avoids possible confusion of a hyphen, as 5-5/96, with a minus sign). The plus and minus signs in the printed text are apparently
indistinguishable dashes - they have been transcribed as '+' and '-' as the context requires.

  <p><i>SIR</i>,</p>

  <p><i>Your acquaintance with the Author before his death was not long,
  which I have oft heard you say, you counted your great unhappinesse, but
  within a short time after, you knew not well whether to count your selfe
  more happie in that you once knew him, or unhappy in that upon your
  acquaintance you so suddenly lost him. This his worke then being to come
  forth to the censorious eye of the world, and as the manner usually is to
  have some Patronage, I have thought good to dedicate it to your selfe;
  and that for these two reasons especially</i>.</p>

  <p><i>First, in respect of the sympathy betwixt it, and your studies;
  Laboures of this nature being usually offered to such persons whose
  profession is that way setled</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Secondly, for the great love and respect you alwayes shewed to the
  Author, being indeed a man that would deserve no lesse, humble, void of
  pride, ever ready to impart his knowledge to others in what kind soever,
  loving and affecting those that affected learning</i>.</p>

  <p><i>For these respects then, I offer to you this Worke of your so much
  honoured friend. I my selfe also (as it is no lesse my duty) for his sake
  striving to make you hereby some part of a requitall, least I should be
  found guilty of ingratitude, which is a solecisme in manners, if having
  so fit an opportunity, I should not expresse to the world some Testimonie
  of love to you, who so much loved him. I desire then (good Sir) your kind
  acceptance of it, you knowing so well the ability of the Author, and
  being also able to judge of a Worke of this nature, and in that respect
  the better able to defend it from the furie of envious Detractours, of
  which there are not few. Thus with my best wishes to you, as to my much

<h3><i>To the Reader.</i></h3>

  <p>Friendly Reader, that which is here set forth to thy view, is a
  Translation out of <i>Ramus</i>. Formerly indeed Translated by one
  M<sup>r</sup>. <i>Thomas Hood</i>, but never before set forth with the
  Demonstrations and Diagrammes, which being cut before the Authors death,
  and the Worke it selfe finished, the Coppie I having in mine hands, never
  had thought for the promulgation of it, but that it should have died with
  its Author, considering no small prejudice usually attends the printing
  of dead mens Workes, and wee see the times, the world is now all eare and
  tongue, the most given with the <i>Athenians</i>, to little else than to
  heare and tell newes: And if <i>Apelles</i> that skilfull Artist alwayes
  found somewhat to be amended in those Pictures which he had most
  curiously drawne; surely much in this Worke might have beene amended if
  the Authour had lived to refine it, but in that it was onely the first
  draught, and that he was prevented by death of a second view, though
  perused by others before the Presse; I was ever unwilling to the
  publication, but that I was often and much solicited with iteration of
  strong importunity, and so in the end over-ruled: perswading me from time
  to time unto it, and that it being finished by the Authour, it was farre
  better to be published, though with some errours and escapes, than to be
  onely moths-meat, and so utterly lost. I would have thee, Courteous
  Reader know, that it is no conceit of the worth of the thing that I
  should expose the name and credit of the Authour to a publike censure;
  yet I durst be bold to say, had he lived to have fitted it, and corrected
  the Presse, the worke would have pointed out the workeman. For I may say,
  without vaine ostentation, he was a man of worth and note, and there was
  not that kinde of learning in which he had not some knowledge, but
  especially for the Easterne tongues, those deepe and profound Studies, in
  the judgement of the learned, which knew him well, he hath not left his
  fellow behind him; as his Workes also in Manuscript now extant in the
  publike Library of the famous Vniversity of Cambridge; do testifie no
  lesse; for him then being so grave and learned a Divine to meddle with a
  worke of this nature, he gives thee a reason in his owne following
  Preface for his principall end and intent of taking this Worke in hand,
  was not for the deepe and Iudiciall, but for the shallowest skull, the
  good and profit of the simpler sort, who as it was in the Latine, were
  able to get little or no benifite from it. Therefore considering the
  worth of the Authour, and his intent in the Worke. Reade it favourably,
  and if the faults be not too great, cover them with the mantle of love,
  and judge charitably offences unwillingly committed, and doe according to
  the termes of equitie, as thou wouldest be done unto, but it is a common
  saying, as <i>Printers</i> get Copies for their profit, so Readers often
  buy and reade for their pleasure; and there is no worke so exactly done
  that can escape the malevolous disposition of some detracting spirits, to
  whom I say, as one well, <i>Facilius est unicuivis nostrum aliena curiosè
  observare: quam proproia negotia rectè agere</i>. It is a great deale
  more easie to carpe at other mens doings, than to give better of his
  owne. And as <i>Arist</i>. <span title="to pasin aresai duscherestaton esti" class="grk"

  &#x1F10;&sigma;&tau;&iota;</span>; <i>omnibus placere difficilimum
  est</i>. But wherefore, Gentle Reader, should I make any doubt of thy
  curtesie, and favourable acceptance; for surely there can be nothing more
  contrary to equitie, than to speake evill of those that have taken paines
  to doe good, a Pagan would hardly doe this, much lesse I hope any good
  Christian. Read then, and if by reading, thou reapest any profit, I have
  my desire, if not, the fault shall be thine owne, reading haply more to
  judge and censure, than for any good and benefit which otherwise may be
  received from it; let but the same mind towards thine owne good possesse
  thee in reading it, as did the Author in writing it, and there shall be
  no neede to doubt of thy profit by it.</p>

<h2>The Authors Preface.</h2>

  <p><i>Two things, I feare me, will here be objected against me: The one
  concerneth my selfe, directly: The other mine Author, and the worke I
  have taken in hand the translating of him. Concerning my selfe, I
  suppose, some will aske, Why I being a Divine; should meddle or busie my
  selfe with these prophane studies? </i>Geometry<i> may no way further
  Divinity, and therefore is no fit study for a Divine? This objection
  seemeth to smell of Brownisme, that is, of a ranke peevish humour
  overflowing the stomach of some, whereby they are caused to loath all
  manner of solid learning, yea of true Divinity it selfe, and therefore it
  doth not deserve an answer: And this we in our Title before signified.
  For we have not taken this paines for Turkes and others, who by the lawes
  of their profession are bound to abandon all manner of learning. But if
  any man shall propose it, as a question, with a desire of satisfaction,
  we are ready to answer him to the best of our abilitie. First, that
  </i>Theologia vera est ars artium &amp; scientia scientiarum<i>, Divinity
  is the Art of Arts, and Science of Sciences; or Divinity is the Mistresse
  upon which all Arts and Sciences are to attend as servants and
  handmaides. And why then not </i>Geometry?<i> But in what place she
  should follow her, I dare not say: For I am no herald, and therefore I
  meddle not with precedencie: But if I were, she should be none of the
  hindermost of her traine</i>.</p>

  <p><i>The Oratour saith, and very truly doubtlesse, That, </i>Omnes
  artes, quæ ad humanitat&#x113; pertinent, habent commune quoddam
  vinculum, &amp; cognatione quadam inter se continentur<i>. All Arts which
  pertaine unto humanity, they have a certaine common bond, and are knit
  together by a kinde of affinity. If then any Arts and Sciences may be
  thought necessary attendants upon this great Lady; Then surely
  </i>Geometry<i> amongst the rest must needes be one: For otherwise her
  traine will be but loose and shattered</i>.</p>

  <p>Plato <i>saith</i> <span title="ton theon akei geômetrein" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F78;&nu; &theta;&epsilon;&#x1F78;&nu;
  &#x1F00;&kappa;&epsilon;&#x1F76;
  &gamma;&epsilon;&omega;&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&rho;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&nu;</span>,
  <i>That God doth alwayes worke by</i> Geometry, <i>that is, as the
  wiseman doth interprete it,</i> <span class="sc">Sap. XI. 21.</span>
  Omnia in mensura &amp; numero &amp; pondere disponere. <i>Dispose all
  things by measure, and number, and weight: Or, as the learned
  </i>Plutarch<i> speaketh; He adorneth and layeth out all the parts of the
  world according to rate, proportion, and similitude. Now who, I pray you,
  understandeth what these termes meane, but he which hath some meane skill
  in </i>Geometry?<i> Therefore none but such an one, may be able to
  declare and teach these things unto others</i>.</p>

  <p><i>How many things are there in holy Scripture which may not well be
  understood without some meane skill in</i> Geometry? <i>The Fabricke and
  bignesse of</i> Noah's <i>Arke: The Sciagraphy of the Temple set out
  by</i> Ezechiel, <i>Who may understand, but he that is skilfull in these
  Arts? I speake not of many and sundry words both in the New and Old
  Testaments, whose genuine and proper signification is merely
  Geometricall: And cannot well be conceived but of a Geometer</i>.</p>

  <p><i>And here, that I may speake it without offence, I would have it
  observed, how many men, much magnified for learning, not onely in their
  speeches, which alwayes are not premeditated, but even in their writings,
  exposed to the view and censure of all men, doe often

  could not so easily and often doe, if they had beene but meanely
  practised in these kinde of studies. Wherefore that Epigramme which was
  used to be written over their Philosophy Schoole doores,</i> <span

  &#x1F00;&gamma;&epsilon;&omega;&mu;&#x1F73;&tau;&rho;&eta;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;
  &epsilon;&#x1F34;&sigma;&iota;&tau;&omega;</span>, <i>No man ignorant
  of</i> Geometry <i>come within these doores: Now written over our
  Divinitie Schooles. And if any man shall thinke this an hard sentence,
  let him heare what Saint </i>Augustine<i> saith in the same case,</i>
  Nemo ad divinarum humanarumq; rerum cognitionem accedat, nisi prius
  annumerandi artem addiscat: <i>Let no man come neither within the
  Divinity nor Philosophy Schooles, except he have first learned
  Arithmeticke. Now that the one of these Arts cannot be learned without
  the other;</i> Euclide <i>our great Master, who made but one of both,
  hath sufficiently demonstrated</i>.</p>

  <p><i>If I should alledge the like practise of famous Divines, greatly
  admired for their great skill in this profession, as</i> T. Peckham
  <i>Arch-Bishop of Canterbury,</i> Maurolycus <i>Bishop of</i> Messana
  <i>in</i> Sicilia, Cusanus <i>Cardinall of</i> Rome, <i>and many others,
  before indifferent judges, I am sure I should not be condemned. Who doth
  not greatly magnifie the grave</i> Seb. Munster, <i>the nimble</i> Ph.
  Melanchthon, <i>and the noble</i> Bernardino Baldo <i>Abbot of</i>
  Guastill, <i>and the painefull</i> Barth. Pitiscus <i>of</i> Grunberg,
  <i>for their knowledge and paines in these Arts and Sciences? And thus
  much shall at this time suffice, to have spoken unto the first Question:
  If any shall require further satisfaction, those I referre unto the
  forenamed Authors, whose authority peradventure may more prevaile with
  them, then my reasons may</i>.</p>

  <p><i>The next is concerning mine Author, and the worke in hand</i>
  Geometry, <i>it must needs be confest we are beholden to</i> Euclides
  <i>Elements for: And he that would be rich in that profession, may have,
  if he be not covetous, his fill there, if he will labour hard, and take
  paines for it, it is true. But in what time thinke yau, may a man learne
  all</i> Euclide, <i>and so by him be made skilfull in this Art? By
  himselfe I know not whether ever or never: And with the helpe of another,
  although very expert, I will not promise him that hee shall attaine to
  perfection in many yeares</i>.</p>

  <p>Hippocrates <i>the Prince of Physicians hath, as they say, in his
  workes laid out the whole Art of Physicke; but I marvell how long a man
  should study him alone, and read him over and over, before he should be a
  good Physician? I feare mee all the friends that he hath, and neighbours
  round about him, yea, and himselfe too, would all die before he should be
  able to hele them, or per adventure ere he should be able to know what
  they ail'd; and after 30, or 40. yeeres of such his study, I would be
  very loath to commit my selfe unto him. How much therefore are the
  students of this noble Science beholding unto those men, who by their
  industry, practise, and painefull travells, have shewed them a ready and
  certaine way through this wildernesse?</i></p>

  <p><i>The Elements of</i> Euclide <i>they do containe generally the whole
  art of</i> Geometry: <i>But if you will offer to travell thorow them
  alone, you shall finde them, I will warrant you, Elements indeed: for
  there you may walke through the spacious Aire, and over the great and
  wide sea, and in and about the vaste and arid wildernesse many a day and
  night, before you shall know where you are. This</i> Ramus, <i>my Authour
  in reading him found to be true; and confesseth himselfe often to have
  beene at a stand: Often to have lost himselfe: Often to have hitte upon a
  rocke, when he had thought he had touch'd land</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Least therefore other men, in this journey doe not likewise loose
  themselves, for the benefit and safety, I meane, of others he hath
  prick'd them out a charde or chack'd out a way, which if thou shalt
  please to follow, it shall lead thee to thy wayes end, as directly, and
  in as short time, as conveniently may be. Yet in what time I cannot
  warrant thee: For all mens capacity, especially in these Arts, is not
  alike: All are not a like painefull, industrious, or diligent: All are
  not of the same ability of body, to be able to continue or sit at it: Or
  all not so free from other imployments or businesse calling them from
  their study, as some others are. For know this for certaine, Thou shalt
  here make no great progresse, except thou doe make it as it were a
  continued labour, Here you must observe that rule of the great
  Painter</i>, Nulla dies sine linea, <i>Let no day passe over your head,
  in which you draw not some diagram or figure or other</i>.</p>

  <p><i>One other thing let me also advise thee of, how capable soever thou
  art, refuse not, if thou maist have it, the helpe of a teacher; For
  except thou be another</i> Hippocrates <i>or</i> Forcatelus, <i>wh&#x14D;
  our Authour mentioneth, thou canst not in these Arts and Sciences attaine
  unto any great perfection without infinite patience and great losse of

  >&Mu;&alpha;&theta;&eta;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#x1F79;&iota;</span>,
  Mathematicks, that is, doctrinal or disciplinary Arts, because they are
  not to be attained unto by our owne information and industry; but by the
  helpe and instruction of others</i>.</p>

  <p><i>This Worke gentle Reader, was in part above 30. yeares since
  published by M.</i> Thomas Hood, <i>a learned man, and loving friend of
  mine, who teaching these Arts, in the Staplers Chappell in Leadenhall
  London, for the benefit of his Schollers and Auditory, did set out the
  Elements apart by themselves. The whole at large, with the Diagrammes,
  and Demonstrations, hee promised, as appeareth in the Preface to that his
  Worke, at his convenient leysure to send out shortly, after them. This
  for ought we know or can learne, is not by him or any other performed:
  And yet are those alone, without these of small use or none to a learner,
  where a teacher is not alwayes at hand. Wherefore we are bold being
  (encouraged thereunto by some private friends, and especially by the
  learned M.</i> H. Brigges, <i>professour of</i> Geometry <i>in the famous
  Vniversity of</i> Oxford) <i>to publish this of ours long since finished
  and ended</i>.</p>

  <p><i>The usuall termes, whether Latine or Greeke, commonly used by
  the</i> Geometers, <i>we have set downe and expressed in English, as well
  as we could, as others, writing of this argument in our language, have
  done before us. These termes, I doubt not, may by some in English
  otherwise be expressed, but how harsh those termes, may unto
  Mathematicall eares, at the first appeare, I will not say; and use in
  short time will make these familiar, and as pleasing to the eare as those
  possibly may be</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Our Authour, in the declaration of the Elements hath many passages,
  which in our judgement doe not make so much for the understanding of the
  matter in hand, as for the defence of the method here used, against</i>
  Aristotle, Euclide, Proclus, <i>and others, which we have therfore wholly
  omitted. Some other things, which in our opinion, might in some respect
  illustrate any particular in this businesse, we have here and there
  inserted. Out of the learned</i> Finkius's Geometria Rotundi, <i>Wee have
  added to the fifth Booke certaine Propositions with their Consectaries
  out of</i> Ptolomi's <i>Almagest. The painfull and diligent</i> Rod.
  Snellius <i>out of the Lectures and Annotations of B.</i> Salignacus, I.

<h1><i>VIA REGIA AD
GEOMETRIAM.</i></h1>

<h2>THE FIRST BOOKE OF
<i>Peter Ramus's</i> Geometry,
<i>Which is of a Magnitude.</i></h2>

<hr class="full" />

  <p><a name="1_e_j"></a> 1. <i>Geometry is the Art of measuring
  well</i>.</p>

  <p>The end or scope of Geometry is to measure well: Therefore it is
  defined of the end, as generally all other Arts are. <i>To measure
  well</i> therefore is to consider the nature and affections of every
  thing that is to be measured: To compare such like things one with
  another: And to understand their reason and proportion and similitude.
  For all that is to measure well, whether it bee that by Congruency and
  application of some assigned measure: Or by Multiplication of the termes
  or bounds: Or by Division of the product made by multiplication: Or by
  any other way whatsoever the affection of the thing to be measured be
  considered.</p>

  <p>But this end of Geometry will appeare much more beautifull and
  glorious in the use and geometricall workes and <!-- Page 2 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>[2]</span>practise then by precepts,
  when thou shalt observe Astronomers, Geographers, Land-meaters, Sea-men,
  Enginers, Architects, Carpenters, Painters, and Carvers, in the
  description and measuring of the Starres, Countries, Lands, Engins, Seas,
  Buildings, Pictures, and Statues or Images to use the helpe of no other
  art but of Geometry. Wherefore here the name of this art commeth farre
  short of the thing meant by it. (For <i>Geometria</i>, made of <i>Gè</i>,
  which in the Greeke language signifieth the Earth; and <i>Métron</i>, a
  measure, importeth no more, but as one would say <i>Land-measuring</i>.
  And <i>Geometra</i>, is but <i>Agrimensor</i>, A land-meter: or as
  <i>Tully</i> calleth him <i>Decempedator</i>, a Pole-man: or as
  <i>Plautus</i>, <i>Finitor</i>, a Marke-man.) when as this Art teacheth
  not only how to measure the Land or the Earth, but the Water, and the
  Aire, yea and the whole World too, and in it all Bodies, Surfaces, Lines,
  and whatsoever else is to bee measured.</p>

  <p>Now <i>a Measure</i>, as <i>Aristotle</i> doth determine it, in every
  thing to be measured, is some small thing conceived and set out by the
  measurer; and of the Geometers it is called <i>Mensura famosa</i>, a
  knowne measure. Which kinde of measures, were at first, as
  <i>Vitruvius</i> and <i>Herodo</i> teache us, taken from mans body:
  whereupon <i>Protagoras</i> sayd, <i>That man was the measure of all
  things</i>, which speech of his, Saint <i>Iohn</i>, <i>Apoc.</i> 21. 17.
  doth seeme to approve. True it is, that beside those, there are some
  other sorts of measures, especially greater ones, taken from other
  things, yet all of them generally made and defined by those. And because
  the stature and bignesse of men is greater in some places, then it is
  ordinarily in others, therefore the measures taken from them are greater
  in some countries, then they are in others. Behold here a catalogue, and
  description of such as are commonly either used amongst us, or some times
  mentioned in our stories and other bookes translated into our English
  tongue.</p>

  <p><i>Granum hordei</i>, a Barley corne, like as a wheat corne in
  weights, is no kinde of measure, but is <i>quiddam minimum <!-- Page 3
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>[3]</span>in mensura</i>,
  some least thing in a measure, whereof it is, as it were, made, and
  whereby it is rectified.</p>

  <p><i>Digitus</i>, a Finger breadth, conteineth 2. barly cornes length,
  or foure layd side to side:</p>

  <p><i>Pollex</i>, a Thumbe breadth; called otherwise <i>Vncia</i>, an
  ynch, 3. barley cornes in length:</p>

  <p><i>Palmus</i>, or <i>Palmus minor</i>, an Handbreadth, 4. fingers, or
  3. ynches.</p>

  <p><i>Spithama</i>, or <i>Palmus major</i>, a Span, 3. hands breadth, or
  9. ynches.</p>

  <p><i>Cubitus</i>, a Cubit, halfe a yard, from the elbow to the top of
  the middle finger, 6. hands breadth, or two spannes.</p>

  <p><i>Ulna</i>, from the top of the shoulder or arme-hole, to the top of
  the middle finger. It is two folde; A yard and an Elne. <i>A yard</i>,
  containeth 2. cubites, or 3. foote: <i>An Elne</i>, one yard and a
  quarter, or 2. cubites and ½.</p>

  <p><i>Pes</i>, a Foot, 4. hands breadth, or twelve ynches.</p>

  <p><i>Gradus</i>, or <i>Passus minor</i>, a Steppe, two foote and an
  halfe.</p>

  <p><i>Passus</i>, or <i>Passus major</i>, a Stride, two steppes, or five
  foote.</p>

  <p><i>Pertica</i>, a Pertch, Pole, Rod or Lugge, 5. yardes and an
  halfe.</p>

  <p><i>Stadium</i>, a Furlong; after the Romans, 125. pases: the English,
  40. rod.</p>

  <p><i>Milliare</i>, or <i>Milliarium</i>, that is <i>mille passus</i>,
  1000. passes, or 8. furlongs.</p>

  <p><i>Leuca</i>, a League, 2. miles: used by the French, spaniards, and
  seamen.</p>

  <p><i>Parasanga</i>, about 4. miles: a Persian, &amp; common Dutch mile;
  30. furlongs.</p>

  <p><i>Sch&oelig;nos</i>, 40. furlongs: an Egyptian, or swedland mile.</p>

  <p>Now for a confirmation of that which hath beene saide, heare the words
  of the Statute.</p>

  <p><i>It is ordained, That 3. graines of Barley, dry and round, do make
  an</i> Ynch: 12. <i>ynches do make a</i> Foote: 3. <i>foote do make a</i>
  <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>[4]</span>Yard:
  <i>5. yardes and ½ doe make a Perch: And 40. perches in length, and 4. in
  breadth, doe make an Aker: 33. Edwar. 1. De terris mensurandis: &amp; De
  compositione ulnarum &amp; Perticarum</i>.</p>

  <p>Item, <i>Bee it enacted by the authority aforesaid; That a</i> Mile
  <i>shall be taken and reckoned in this manner, and no otherwise; That is
  to say,</i> a Mile <i>to containe 8. furlongs: And every</i> Furlong
  <i>to containe 40. lugges or poles: And every</i> Lugge <i>or</i> Pole
  <i>to containe 16. foote and ½. 25. Eliza.</i> An Act for restraint of
  new building, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>These, as I said, are according to diverse countries, where they are
  used, much different one from another: which difference, in my judgment;
  ariseth especially out of the difference of the Foote, by which generally
  they are all made, whether they be greater of lesser. For the Hand being
  as before hath beene taught, the fourth part of the foot whether greater
  or lesser: And the Ynch, the third part of the hand, whether greater or
  lesser.</p>

  <p><i>Item</i>, the Yard, containing 3. foote, whether greater or lesser:
  And the Rodde 5. yardes and ½, whether greater or lesser, and so forth of
  the rest; It must needes follow, that the Foote beeing in some places
  greater then it is in other some, these measures, the Hand, I meane, the
  Ynch, the Yard, the Rod, must needes be greater or lesser in some places
  then they are in other. Of this diversity therefore, and difference of
  the foot, in forreine countries, as farre as mine intelligence will
  informe me, because the place doth invite me, I will here adde these few
  lines following. For of the rest, because they are of more speciall use,
  I will God willing, as just occasion shall be administred, speake more
  plentifully hereafter.</p>

  <p>Of this argument divers men have written somewhat, more or lesse: But
  none to my knowledge, more copiously and curiously, then <i>Iames
  Capell</i>, a Frenchman, and the learned <i>Willebrand</i>,
  <i>Snellius</i>, of <i>Leiden</i> in Holland, for they have compared, and
  that very diligently, many and sundry kinds of these measures one with
  another. The first as you may <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page5"></a>[5]</span>see in his treatise <i>De mensuris
  intervallorum</i> describeth these eleven following: of which the
  greatest is <i>Pes Babylonius</i>, the Babylonian foote; the least,
  <i>Pes Toletanus</i>, the foote used about <i>Toledo</i> in Spaine: And
  the meane betweene both, <i>Pes Atticus</i>, that used about
  <i>Athens</i> in Greece. For they are one unto another as 20. 15. and 12.
  are one unto another. Therefore if the Spanish foote, being the least, be
  devided into 12. ynches, and every inch againe into 10. partes, and so
  the whole foote into 120. the <i>Atticke</i> foote shall containe of
  those parts 150. and the <i>Babylonian</i>, 200. To this <i>Atticke</i>
  foote, of all other, doth ours come the neerest: For our <i>English</i>
  foote comprehendeth almost 152. such parts.</p>

  <p>The other, to witt the learned <i>Snellius</i>, in his <i>Eratosthenes
  Batavus</i>, a booke which hee hath written of the true quantity of the
  compasse of the Earth, describeth many more, and that after a farre more
  exact and curious manner.</p>

  <p>Here observe, that besides those by us here set downe, there are
  certaine others by him mentioned, which as hee writeth are found wholly
  to agree with some one or other of these. For <i>Rheinlandicus</i>, that
  of <i>Rheinland</i> or <i>Leiden</i>, which hee maketh his base, is all
  one with <i>Romanus</i>, the <i>Italian</i> or <i>Roman</i> foote.
  <i>Lovaniensis</i>, that of <i>Lovane</i>, with that of <i>Antwerpe</i>:
  <i>Bremensis</i>, that of <i>Breme</i> in <i>Germany</i>, with that of
  <i>Hafnia</i>, in <i>Denmarke</i>. Onely his <i>Pes Arabicus</i>, the
  <i>Arabian</i> foote, or that mentioned in <i>Abulfada</i>, and
  <i>Nubiensis</i>: the Geographers I have overpassed, because hee dareth
  not, for certeine, affirme what it was.</p>

  <i>Pedem nostrum Angli cum Græcorum pedi æqualem invenimus, comparatione
  facta <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page7"></a>[7]</span>cum Græcorum pede, quem Agricola &amp; alij ex

  <p>Now by any one of these knowne and compared with ours, to all English
  men well knowne the rest may easily be proportioned out.</p>

  <p><a name="2_e_j"></a> 2. <i>The thing proposed to bee measured is a
  Magnitude</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Magnitudo</i>, a Magnitude or Bignesse is the subject about which
  Geometry is busied. For every Art hath a proper subject about which it
  doth employ al his rules and precepts: And by this especially they doe
  differ one from another. So the subject of Grammar was speech; of
  Logicke, reason; of Arithmeticke, numbers; and so now of Geometry it is a
  magnitude, all whose kindes, differences and affections, are hereafter to
  be declared.</p>

  <p><a name="3_e_j"></a> 3. <i>A Magnitude is a continuall
  quantity</i>.</p>

  <p>A Magnitude is <i>quantitas continua</i>, a continued, or continuall
  quantity. A number is <i>quantitas discreta</i>, a disjoined quantity: As
  one, two, three, foure; doe consist of one, two, three, foure unities,
  which are disjoyned and severed parts: whereas the parts of a Line,
  Surface, and Body are contained and continued without any manner of
  disjunction, separation, or distinction at all, as by and by shall better
  and more plainely appeare. Therefore a Magnitude is here understood to be
  that whereby every thing to be measured is said to bee great: As a Line
  from hence is said to be long, a Surface broade, a Body solid: Wherefore
  Length, Breadth, and solidity are Magnitudes.</p>

  <p><a name="4_e_j"></a> 4. <i>That is</i> continuum, <i>continuall, whose
  parts are contained or held together by some common bound</i>.</p>

  <p>This definition of it selfe is somewhat obscure, and to be <!-- Page 8
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>[8]</span>understand onely
  in a geometricall sense: And it dependeth especially of the common
  bounde. For the parts (which here are so called) are nothing in the
  whole, but in a <i>potentia</i> or powre: Neither indeede may the whole
  magnitude bee conceived, but as it is compact of his parts, which
  notwithstanding wee may in all places assume or take as conteined and
  continued with a common bound, which Aristotle nameth a <i>Common
  limit</i>; but <i>Euclide</i> a <i>Common section</i>, as in a line, is a
  Point, in a surface, a Line: in a body, a Surface.</p>

  <p><a name="5_e_j"></a> 5. <i>A bound is the outmost of a
  Magnitude</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Terminus</i>, a Terme, or Bound is here understood to bee that
  which doth either bound, limite, or end <i>actu</i>, in deede; as in the
  beginning and end of a magnitude: Or <i>potentia</i>, in powre or
  ability, as when it is the common bound of the continuall magnitude.
  Neither is the Bound a parte of the bounded magnitude: For the thing
  bounding is one thing, and the thing bounded is another: For the Bound is
  one distance, dimension, or degree, inferiour to the thing bounded: A
  Point is the bound of a line, and it is lesse then a line by one degree,
  because it cannot bee divided, which a line may. A Line is the bound of a
  surface, and it is also lesse then a surface by one distance or
  dimension, because it is only length, wheras a surface hath both length
  and breadth. A Surface is the bound of a body, and it is lesse likewise
  then it is by one dimension, because it is onely length and breadth,
  whereas as a body hath both length, breadth, and thickenesse.</p>

  <p>Now every Magnitude <i>actu</i>, in deede, is terminate, bounded and
  finite, yet the geometer doth desire some time to have an infinite line
  granted him, but no otherwise infinite or farther to bee drawane out then
  may serve his turne. <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page9"></a>[9]</span></p>

  <p><a name="6_e_j"></a> 6. <i>A Magnitude is both infinitely made, and
  continued, and cut or divided by those things wherewith it is
  bounded</i>.</p>

  <p>A line, a surface, and a body are made gemetrically by the motion of a
  point, line, and surface: Item, they are conteined, continued, and cut or
  divided by a point, line, and surface. But a Line is bounded by a point:
  a surface, by a line: And a Body by a surface, as afterward by their
  severall kindes shall be understood.</p>

  <p>Now that all magnitudes are cut or divided by the same wherewith they
  are bounded, is conceived out of the definition of <i>Continuum</i>, e.
  4. For if the common band to containe and couple together the parts of a
  Line, surface, &amp; Body, be a Point, Line, and Surface, it must needes
  bee that a section or division shall be made by those common bandes: And
  that to bee dissolved which they did containe and knitt together.</p>

  <p><a name="7_e_j"></a> 7. <i>A point is an undivisible signe in a
  magnitude</i>.</p>

  <p>A Point, as here it is defined, is not naturall and to bee perceived
  by sense; Because sense onely perceiveth that which is a body; And if
  there be any thing lesse then other to be perceived by sense, that is
  called a Point. Wherefore a Point is no Magnitude: But it is onely that
  which in a Magnitude is conceived and imagined to bee undivisible. And
  although it be voide of all bignesse or Magnitude, yet is it the
  beginning of all magnitudes, the beginning I meane <i>potentiâ</i>, in
  powre.</p>

  <p><a name="8_e_j"></a> 8. <i>Magnitudes commensurable, are those which
  one and the same measure doth measure: Contrariwise, Magnitudes
  incommensurable are those, which the same measure cannot measure.</i> 1,
  2. d. X.</p>

  <p>Magnitudes compared betweene themselves in respect of numbers have
  Symmetry or commensurability, and <!-- Page 10 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>[10]</span>Reason or rationality: Of
  themselves, Congruity and Adscription. But the measure of a magnitude is
  onely by supposition, and at the discretion of the Geometer, to take as
  pleaseth him, whether an ynch, an hand breadth, foote, or any other thing
  whatsoever, for a measure. Therefore two magnitudes, the one a foote
  long, the other two foote long, are commensurable; because the magnitude
  of one foote doth measure them both, the first once, the second twice.
  But some magnitudes there are which have no common measure, as the
  Diagony of a quadrate and his side, 116. p. X. <i>actu</i>, in deede, are
  <i>Asymmetra</i>, incommensurable: And yet they are <i>potentiâ</i>, by
  power, <i>symmetra</i>, commensurable, to witt by their quadrates: For
  the quadrate of the diagony is double to the quadrate of the side.</p>

  <p><a name="9_e_j"></a> 9. <i>Rationall Magnitudes are those whose reason
  may bee expressed by a number of the measure given. Contrariwise they are
  irrationalls.</i> 5. d. X.</p>

  <p><i>Ratio</i>, Reason, Rate, or Rationality, what it is our Authour
  (and likewise <i>Salignacus</i>) have taught us in the first Chapter of
  the second booke of their Arithmetickes: Thither therefore I referre
  thee.</p>

  <p><i>Data mensura</i>, a Measure given or assigned, is of <i>Euclide</i>
  called <i>Rhetè</i>, that is spoken, (or which may be uttered) definite,
  certaine, to witt which may bee expressed by some number, which is no
  other then that, which as we said, was called <i>mensura famosa</i>, a
  knowne or famous measure.</p>

  <p>Therefore Irrationall magnitudes, on the contrary, are understood to
  be such whose reason or rate may not bee expressed by a number or a
  measure assigned: As the side of the side of a quadrate of 20. foote unto
  a magnitude of two foote; of which kinde of magnitudes, thirteene sorts
  are mentioned in the tenth booke of <i>Euclides Elements</i>: such are
  the segments of a right line proportionally cutte, unto the whole line.
  The Diameter in a circle is rationall: <!-- Page 11 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>[11]</span>But it is irrationall
  unto the side of an inscribed quinquangle: The Diagony of an Icosahedron
  and Dodecahedron is irrationall unto the side.</p>

  <p><a name="10_e_j"></a> 10. <i>Congruall or agreeable magnitudes are
  those, whose parts beeing applyed or laid one upon another doe fill an
  equall place</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Symmetria</i>, Symmetry or Commensurability and Rate were from
  numbers: The next affections of Magnitudes are altogether
  geometricall.</p>

  <p><i>Congruentia</i>, Congruency, Agreeablenesse is of two magnitudes,
  when the first parts of the one doe agree to the first parts of the
  other, the meane to the meane, the extreames or ends to the ends, and
  lastly the parts of the one, in all respects to the parts, of the other:
  so Lines are congruall or agreeable, when the bounding, points of the
  one, applyed to the bounding points of the other, and the whole lengths
  to the whole lengthes, doe occupie or fill the same place. So Surfaces
  doe agree, when the bounding lines, with the bounding lines: And the
  plots bounded, with the plots bounded doe occupie the same place. Now
  bodies if they do agree, they do seeme only to agree by their surfaces.
  And by this kind of congruency do we measure the bodies of all both
  liquid and dry things, to witt, by filling an equall place. Thus also doe
  the moniers judge the monies and coines to be equall, by the equall
  weight of the plates in filling up of an equall place. But here note,
  that there is nothing that is onely a line, or a surface onely, that is
  naturall and sensible to the touch, but whatsoever is naturall, and thus
  to be discerned is corporeall.</p>

  figures of divers kindes are also adscribed, to witt the five ordinate
  plaine bodies betweene themselves: And a right line is inscribed within a
  periphery and a triangle.</p>

  <p>But the use of adscription of a rectilineall and circle, shall
  hereafter manifest singular and notable mysteries by the reason and
  meanes of adscripts; which adscription shall be the key whereby a way is

  <p>The Common affections of a magnitude are hitherto declared: The
  <i>Species</i> or kindes doe follow: for other then this division our
  authour could not then meete withall.</p>

  </div>
  <p><a name="2_e_ij"></a> 2. <i>A Line is a Magnitude onely long</i>.</p>

  <p>As are <i>ae.</i> <i>io.</i> and <i>uy.</i> such a like Magnitude is
  conceived in the measuring of waies, or distance of one place from
  another: And by the difference of a lightsome place from a darke:
  <i>Euclide</i> at the 2 <i>d j.</i> defineth a line to be a length void
  of breadth: And indeede length is the proper difference of a line, as
  breadth is of a face, and solidity of a body.</p>

  <p><a name="3_e_ij"></a> 3. <i>The bound of a line is a point</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Euclide</i> at the 3. <i>d j.</i> saith that the extremities or
  ends of a line are points. Now seeing that a Periphery or an hoope line
  hath neither beginning nor ending, it seemeth not to bee bounded with
  points: But when it is described or made it beginneth at a point, and it
  endeth at a pointe. Wherefore a Point is the bound of a line, sometime
  <i>actu</i>, in deed, as in a right line: sometime <i>potentiâ</i>, in a
  possibility, as in a perfect periphery. Yea in very deede, as before was
  taught in the definition of <i>continuum</i>, 4 <i>e.</i> all lines,
  whether they bee right lines, or crooked, are contained or continued with
  points. But a line is made by the <!-- Page 14 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>[14]</span>motion of a point. For
  every magnitude generally is made by a geometricall motion, as was even
  now taught, and it shall afterward by the severall kindes appeare, how by
  one motion whole figures are made: How by a conversion, a Circle,
  Spheare, Cone, and Cylinder: How by multiplication of the base and
  heighth, rightangled parallelogrammes are made.</p>

  <p><a name="4_e_ij"></a> 4. <i>A Line is either Right or Crooked</i>.</p>

  <p>This division is taken out of the 4 d j. of <i>Euclide</i>, where
  rectitude or straightnes is attributed to a line, as if from it both
  surfaces and bodies were to have it. And even so the rectitude of a solid
  figure, here-after shall be understood by a right line perpendicular from
  the toppe unto the center of the base. Wherefore rectitude is propper
  unto a line: And therefore also obliquity or crookednesse, from whence a
  surface is judged to be right or oblique, and a body right or
  oblique.</p>

  <p><a name="5_e_ij"></a> 5. <i>A right line is that which lyeth equally
  betweene his owne bounds: A crooked line lieth contrariwise.</i> 4. <i>d.
  j</i>.</p>

  <p>Now a line lyeth equally betweene his owne bounds, when it is not here
  lower, nor there higher: But is equall to the space comprehended betweene
  the two bounds or ends: As here <i>ae.</i> is, so hee that maketh
  <i>rectum iter</i>, a journey in a straight line, commonly he is said to
  treade so much ground, as he needes must, and no more: He goeth
  <i>obliquum iter</i>, a crooked way, which goeth more then he needeth, as
  <i>Proclus</i> saith.</p>

  <p><i>Linea recta</i>, a straight or right line is that, as <i>Plato</i>
  defineth it, whose middle points do hinder us from seeing both the
  extremes at once; As in the eclipse of the Sunne, if a right line should
  be drawne from the Sunne, by the Moone, unto our eye, the body of the
  Moone beeing in the midst, would hinder our sight, and would take away
  the sight of the Sunne from us: which is taken from the Opticks, in which
  we are taught, that we see by straight beames or rayes. Therfore to lye
  equally betweene the boundes, that is by an equall distance: to bee the
  shortest betweene the same bounds; And that the middest doth hinder the
  sight of the extremes, is all one.</p>

  circle and drawne out farther, doth not cut the circle, 2 <i>d</i> 3. as

  <i>Euclide</i>, at the 15. d. j. frame the definition of a Periphery: And

  <p>Now the line that is turned about, may in a plaine, bee either a right

  <p>Hitherto straightnesse and crookednesse have beene the affections of

  both to right and crooked lines. Perpendicularity is first generally
  defined thus:</p>

  <p>Lines are right betweene themselves, that is, perpendicular one unto
  another, when the one of them lighting upon the other, standeth upright
  and inclineth or leaneth neither way. So two right lines in a plaine may
  bee perpendicular; as are <i>ae.</i> and <i>io.</i> so two peripheries
  upon a sphearicall may be perpendiculars, when the one of them falling
  upon the other, standeth indifferently betweene, and doth not incline or
  leane either way. So a right line may be <!-- Page 19 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>[19]</span>perpendicular unto a
  periphery, if falling upon it, it doe reele neither way, but doe ly
  indifferently betweene either side. And in deede in all respects lines
  right betweene themselves, and perpendicular lines are one and the same.
  And from the perpendicularity of lines, the perpendicularity of surfaces
  is taken, as hereafter shall appeare. Of the perpendicularity of bodies,
  <i>Euclide</i> speaketh not one word in his <i>Elements</i>, &amp; yet a
  body is judged to be right, that is, plumme or perpendicular unto another
  body, by a perpendicular line.</p>

<h2>The third Booke of <i>Geometry</i>.
Of an Angle.</h2>

  <p><a name="1_e_iij"></a> 1. <i>A lineate is a Magnitude more then
  long</i>.</p>

  <p>A New forme of doctrine hath forced our Authour to use oft times new
  words, especially in dividing, that the logicall lawes and rules of more
  perfect division by a dichotomy, that is into two kindes, might bee held
  and observed. Therefore a Magnitude was divided into two kindes, to witt
  into a Line and a Lineate: And a Lineate is made the <i>genus</i> of a
  surface and a Body. Hitherto a Line, which of all bignesses is the first
  and most simple, hath been described: Now followeth a Lineate, the other
  kinde of magnitude opposed as you see to a line, followeth next in order.
  <i>Lineatum</i> therefore a Lineate, or <i>Lineamentum</i>, a Lineament,
  (as by the authority of our Authour himselfe, the learned <i>Bernhard
  Salignacus</i>, who was his Scholler, hath corrected it) is that
  Magnitude in which there are lines: Or which is made of lines, or as our
  Authour here, which is more then long: Therefore lines may be drawne in a
  surface, which is the proper soile or plots of lines; They may also be
  drawne in a body, as the Diameter in a Prisma: the axis in a spheare; and
  generally all lines falling from aloft: And therfore <i>Proclus</i>
  maketh some plaine, other solid lines. So Conicall lines, as the
  Ellipsis, Hyperbole, and Parabole, are called solid lines because they do
  arise from the cutting of a body.</p>

  <p><a name="2_e_iij"></a> 2. <i>To a Lineate belongeth an Angle and a
  Figure</i>.</p>

  <p>The common affections of a Magnitude were to be bounded, cutt, jointly
  measured, and adscribed: Then of a line to be right, crooked, touch'd,
  turn'd about, and <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page22"></a>[22]</span>wreathed: All which are in a lineate by
  meanes of a line. Now the common affections of a Lineate are to bee
  Angled and Figured. And surely an Angle and a figure in all Geometricall
  businesses doe fill almost both sides of the leafe. And therefore both of
  them are diligently to be considered.</p>

  <p><a name="3_e_iij"></a> 3. <i>An Angle is a lineate in the common
  section of the bounds</i>.</p>

  <p>So <i>Angulus Superficiarius</i>, a superficiall Angle, is a surface
  consisting in the common section of two lines: So <i>angulus solidus</i>,
  a solid angle, in the common section of three surfaces at the least.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:30%;">
      <a href="images/042.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/042.png"
      alt="Angles." title="Angles." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>[But the learned B. <i>Salignacus</i> hath observed, that all angles
  doe not consist in the common section of the bounds, Because the touching
  of circles, either one another, or a rectilineal surface doth make an
  angle without any cutting of the bounds: And therefore he defineth it
  thus: <i>Angulus est terminorum inter se invicem inclinantium concursus:
  An angle is the meeting of bounds, one leaning towards another.</i>] So
  is <i>aei.</i> a superficiall angle: [And such also are the angles
  <i>ouy.</i> and <i>bcd.</i>] so is the angle <i>o.</i> a solid angle, to
  witt comprehended of the three surfaces <i><span class="correction"
  title="text reads `aei.'">aoi.</span></i> <i>ioe.</i> and <i>aoe.</i>
  Neither may a surface, of 2. dimensions, be bounded with <!-- Page 23
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>[23]</span>one right line:
  Nor a body, of three dimensions, bee bounded with two, at lest beeing
  plaine surfaces.</p>

  <p><a name="4_e_iij"></a> 4. <i>The shankes of an angle are the bounds
  compreding the angle</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Scèle</i> or <i>Crura</i>, the Shankes, Legges, H. are the bounds
  insisting or standing upon the base of the angle, which in the Isosceles
  only or Equicrurall triangle are so named of <i>Euclide</i>, otherwise he
  nameth them <i>Latera</i>, sides. So in the examples aforesaid,
  <i>ea.</i> and <i>ei.</i> are the shankes of the superficiary angle
  <i>e</i>; And so are the three surfaces <i><span class="correction"
  title="text reads `aei.'">aoi.</span></i> <i>ieo.</i> and <i>aeo.</i> the
  shankes of the said angle <i>o</i>. Therefore the shankes making the
  angle are either Lines or Surfaces: And the lineates formed or made into
  Angles, are either Surfaces or Bodies.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:15%;">
      <a href="images/044.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/044.png"
      alt="Lunular Angles, etc." title="Lunular Angles, etc." /></a>
  </div>
  <p><a name="5_e_iij"></a> 5. <i>Angles homogeneall, are angles of the
  same kinde, both in respect of their shankes, as also in the maner of
  meeting of the same:</i> [<i>Heterogeneall, are those which differ one
  from another in one, or both these conditions.</i>]</p>

  <p>Therefore this <i>Homogenia</i>, or similitude of angles is twofolde,
  the first is of shanks; the other is of the manner of meeting of the
  shankes: so rectilineall right angles, are angles homogeneall betweene
  themselves. But right-lined right angles, and oblique-lined right angles
  between themselves, are heterogenealls. So are neither all obtusangles
  compared to all obtusangles: Nor all acutangles, to all acutangles,
  homogenealls, except both these conditions doe concurre, to witt the
  similitude both of shanke and manner of meeting. <i>Lunularis</i>, a
  Lunular, or Moonlike corner angle is homogeneall to a <i>Systroides</i>
  and <i>Pelecoides</i>, Hatchet formelike, in shankes: For each of these
  are comprehended of <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page24"></a>[24]</span>peripheries: The Lunular of one convexe; the
  other concave; as <i><span class="correction" title="there was no letter u on the printed diagram, inserted in place which fits the text"
  >iue</span></i>. The Systroides of both convex, as <i>iao</i>. The
  Pelecoides of both concave, as <i>eau</i>. And yet a lunular, in respect
  of the meeting of the shankes is both to the Systroides and Pelecoides
  heterogeneall: And therefore it is absolutely heterogeneall to it.</p>

  <p><a name="6_e_iij"></a> 6. <i>Angels congruall in shankes are
  equall</i>.</p>

  <p>This is drawne out of the <a href="#10_e_j">10. e j</a>. For if twice
  two shanks doe agree, they are not foure, but two shankes, neither are
  they two equall angles, but one angle. And this is that which
  <i>Proclus</i> speaketh of, at the 4. p j. when hee saith, that a right
  lined angle is equall to a right lined angle, when one of the shankes of
  the one put upon one of the shankes of the other, the other two doe
  agree: when that other shanke fall without, the angle of the out-falling
  shanke is the greater: when it falleth within, it is lesser: For there is
  comprehendeth; here it is comprehended.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding although congruall or agreeable angles be equall: yet
  are not congruity and equality reciprocall or convertible: For a Lunular
  may bee equall to a right <!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page25"></a>[25]</span>lined right angle, as here thou seest: For
  the angles of equall semicircles <i>ieo.</i> and <i>aeu.</i> are equall,
  as application doth shew. The angle <i>aeo.</i> is common both to the
  right angle <i>aei.</i> and to the lunar <i>aueo.</i> Let therefore the
  equall angle <i>aeo.</i> bee added to both: the right angle <i>aei.</i>
  shall be equall to the Lunular <i>aueo</i>.</p>

  reciprocall: The second is not. [And therefore is this Consectary, by the
  learned B. <i>Salignacus</i>, justly, according to the judgement of the

  translate it. <i>If being equall in the base, it bee lesser in the feete
  (the feete being conteined within the feete of the other angle) it is the
  greater angle.</i> [That is, if one angle enscribed within another angle,
  be equall in base, the angle of the inscribed shall be greater then the
  angle of the circumscribed.]</p>

  <p>As here the angle <i><span class="correction" title="text interchanges aei and aoi."
  >aoi.</span></i> within the angle <i>aei.</i> And the bases are equall,
  to witt one and the same; Therefore <i>aoi.</i> the inner angle is
  greater then <i>aei.</i> the outter angle. <i>Inner</i> is added of
  necessity: For otherwise there will, in the section or cutting one of
  another, appeare a manifest errour. All these consectaries are drawne out
  of that same axiome of congruity, to witt out of the <a
  href="#10_e_j">10. e j</a>. as <i>Proclus</i> doth plainely affirme and
  teach: It seemeth saith hee, that the equalities of shankes and bases,
  doth cause the equality of the verticall angles. For neither, if the
  bases be equall, doth the equality of the shankes leave the same or
  equall angles: But if the base bee lesser, the angle decreaseth: If
  greater, it increaseth. Neither if the bases bee equall, and the shankes
  unequall, doth the angle remaine the same: But when they are made lesse,
  it is increased: when they are made greater, it is diminished: For the
  contrary falleth out to the angles and shankes of the angles. For if thou
  shalt imagine the shankes to be in the same base thrust downeward, thou
  makest them lesse, but their angle greater: but if thou do againe
  conceive them to be pul'd up higher, thou makest them greater, but their
  angle lesser. For looke how much more neere they come one to another, so
  much farther off is the toppe removed from the base: wherefore you may
  boldly affirme, that the same <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>As here the angle <i>aio.</i> is a right angle, as is also <i>oie.</i>
  because the shanke <i>oi.</i> is right, that is, perpendicular to
  <i>ae.</i> [The instrument wherby they doe make triall which is a right

  Heighths, by the Perpendicular or Plumbe: And Angles, by the <span

  Contrariwise, an Oblique angle it is, when the one shanke standeth so
  upon another, that it inclineth, or leaneth more to one side, then it
  doth to the other: And one angle on the one side, is greater then that on

  <p>The axiomes of the equality of angles were three, as even now wee

  <p>Angles therfore homogeneall and recticrurall, that is whose shankes
  are right, as are right lines, as plaine surfaces (For let us so take the
  word) are equall right <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page30"></a>[30]</span>angles. So are the above written
  rectilineall right angles equall: so are plaine solid right angles, as in
  a cube, equall. The axiome may therefore generally be spoken of solid
  angles, so they be recticruralls: Because all semicircular right angles
  are not equall to all semicircular right angles: As here, when the
  diameter is continued it is perpendicular, and maketh twice two angles,
  within and without, the outter equall betweene themselves, and inner
  equall betweene themselves: But the outer unequall to the inner: And the
  angle of a greater semicircle is greater, then the angle of a lesser.
  Neither is this affection any way reciprocall, That all equall angles
  should bee right angles. For oblique angles may bee equall betweene
  themselves: And an oblique angle may bee made equall to a right angle, as
  a Lunular to a rectilineall right angle, as was manifest, at the <a
  href="#6_e_iij">6 e</a>.</p>

  <p>The definition of an oblique is understood by the obliquity of the
  shankes: whereupon also it appeareth; That an oblique angle is unequall
  to an homogeneall right angle: Neither indeed may oblique angles be made

  figure</i>.</p>

  <p>In some part of a figure the Center, Perimeter, Radius, Diameter and
  Altitude are to be considered. The Center therefore is a point in the
  midst of the figure; so in the triangle, quadrate, and circle, the center
  is, <i>aei</i>.</p>

  perimeter of a Triangle is one line made or compounded of three lines. So
  the perimeter of the triangle <i>a</i>, is <i>eio.</i> So the perimeter
  of the circle <i>a</i> is a periphery, as in <i>eio.</i> So the perimeter

  the points of the periphery. So in a speare and all rounds the thing is
  more easie to be conceived, where the diameters are equall: yet
  notwithstanding in other figures the thing is the same. Because the
  diameter is a right line inscribed by the center, whether from corner to
  corner, or side to side, the matter skilleth not. Therefore that there

  <p>As here thou seest <i>a, e, i</i> this ariseth out of the definition
  of the diameter. For because the diameter is inscribed into the figure by
  the center: Therefore the Center of the figure must needes be in the

  <p>This consectary, saith the learned Rod. Snellius, is as it were a

  for that in every figure <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  therefore it must also needs be in the meeting of them: Otherwise there

  <p>In plaines the Equilater triangle is onely an ordinate figure, the
  rest are all inordinate: In quadrangles, the Quadrate is ordinate, all
  other of that sort are inordinate: In every sort of Multangles, or many
  cornered figures one may be an ordinate. In crooked lined figures the
  Circle is ordinate, because it is conteined with equall bounds, (one
  bound alwaies equall to it selfe being taken for infinite many,) because
  it is equiangled, seeing (although in deede there be in it no angle) the
  inclination notwithstanding is every where alike and equall, and as it
  were the angle of the perphery be alwaies alike unto it selfe: whereupon
  of Plato and Plutarch a circle is said to be <i>Polygonia</i>, a
  multangle; and of Aristotle <i>Holegonia</i>, a totangle, nothing else
  but one whole angle. In mingled-lined figures there is nothing that is
  ordinate: In <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page38"></a>[38]</span>solid bodies, and pyramids the Tetrahedrum
  is ordinate: Of Prismas, the Cube: of Polyhedrum's, three onely are
  ordinate, the octahedrum, the Dodecahedrum, and the Icosahedrum. In
  oblique-lined bodies, the spheare is concluded to be ordinate, by the
  same argument that a circle was made to bee ordinate.</p>

  <p>So in plaines the triangle is a prime figure, because it cannot be
  divided into any other more simple figure although it may be cut many
  waies: And in solids, the Pyramis is a first figure: Because it cannot be
  divided into a more simple solid figure, although it may be divided into

  as of a Pyramis all bodies or solids are compounded; such are <i>aei.</i>

  <p>So <i>Euclide</i>, at the 1. d. ij. saith, that a rightangled
  parallelogramme is comprehended of two right lines perpendicular one to
  another, videlicet one multiplied by the other. For Geometricall
  comprehension is sometimes as it were in numbers a multiplication:
  Therefore if yee shall grant the base and height to bee rationalls
  betweene themselves, <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page39"></a>[39]</span>that their reason I meane may be expressed
  by a number of the assigned measure, then the numbers of their sides
  being multiplyed one by another, the bignesse of the figure shall be
  expressed. Therefore a Rationall figure is made by the multiplying of two
  rationall sides betweene themselves.</p>

  inequilater triangle; and an equicrurall, greater then an unequicrurall:
  so in quadrangles, the quadrate is greater then that which is not a
  quadrate: so an oblong more ordinate, is greater then an oblong lesse
  ordinate. So of those figures which are heterogeneall ordinates, the
  quadrate is greater then the Triangle: And the Circle, then the Quadrate.

  <p>The proportion of first figures is here twofold; the first is direct
  in those which are of equall height. In Arithmeticke we learned; That if
  one number doe multiply many numbers, the products shall be proportionall
  unto the numbers, multiplyed. From hence in rationall figures the content
  of those which are of equall height is to bee expressed by a number. As
  in two right angled parallelogrammes, let 4. the same height, multiply 2.
  and 3. the bases: The products 8. and 12. the parallelogrammes made, are
  directly proportionall unto the bases 2. and 3. Therefore as 2. is unto
  3. so is 8. unto 12. The same shall afterward appeare in right Prismes
  and Cylinders. In plaines, Parallelogramms are the doubles of triangles:
  In solids, Prismes are the triples of pyramides: Cylinders, the triples
  of Cones. The converse of this element is plaine out of the former also:
  First figures if they be in reason one to another as their bases are,
  then are they of equall height, to witt when their products are
  proportionall unto the multiplyed, the same number did multiply them.</p>

  <p>The second kind of proportion of first figures is reciprocall. This
  kinde of proportion rationall and expressible by a number, is not to be
  had in first figures themselves: but in those that are equally manifold
  to them, as was taught even now in direct proportion: As for example, Let
  these two right angled parallelogrammes, unequall in bases and heighths
  3, 8, 4, 6, be as heere thou seest: The proportion reciprocall is thus,
  As 3 the base of the one, is unto 4, the base of the other: so is 6. the
  height of the one is to 8. the height of the other: And the
  parallelogrammes are equall, viz. 24. and 24. Againe, let two solids of
  unequall bases &amp; heights (for here also the base is taken for the
  length and heighth) be 12, 2, 3, <span class="correction" title="text reads `0', cf. the diagram"
  >6</span>, 3, 4. The solids themselves shall be 72. and 72, as here thou
  seest; and the proportion of the bases and heights likewise is
  reciprocall: For as 24, is unto 18, so is 4, unto 3. The cause is out of
  the golden rule of proportion in Arithmeticke: Because twice two sides
  are <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page42"></a>[42]</span>proportionall: Therefore the plots made of
  them shall be equall. And againe, by the same rule, because the plots are

  And therefore they have but a doubled reason of their homologall sides.
  Solids have three dimensions, videl. Length, Breadth, &amp; thicknesse:
  therefore they shall have a treabled reason of their homologall or

  unto 9. In Triangles, which are the halfes of rightangled

  <p>Said numbers are alike in the trebled reason of their homologall

  comprehended in those numbers are like-solids, as here thou seest:
  Because their sides, 4. 3. 5. and 8. 6. 10. are proportionall betweene
  themselves. But the reason of 60. to 480. is the reason of 4. to 8.

  <p>Thus farre of the first part of this element: The second, that like
  figurs have a meane, proportional lesse by one, then are their
  dimensions, shall be declared by few words. For plaines having but two
  dimensions, have but one meane proportionall, solids having three
  dimensions, have two meane proportionalls. The cause is onely
  Arithmeticall, as afore. For where the bounds are but 4. as they are in
  two plaines, there can be found no more but one meane proportionall, as
  in the former example of 8. and 18. where the homologall or correspondent
  sides are 2. 3. and 4. 6.</p>

  This may in some part be conceived and understood by numbers. As for
  example, Let the lines given, be 2. foot, 4. foote, and 8 foote. And upon
  the first and second, let there be made like figures, of 6. foote and 24.
  foote; So I meane, that 2. and 4. be the bases of them. Here as 2. the

  <p>Moreover by this Consectary a way is laid open leading unto the reason

  <p>The cause also is here the same, that was before: To witt, because

  <p><a name="27_e_iiij"></a> 27. <i>Figures filling a place, are those
  which being any way set about the same point, doe leave no voide
  roome</i>.</p>

  <p>This was the definition of the ancient Geometers, as appeareth out of
  <i>Simplicius</i>, in his commentaries upon the 8. chapter of
  <i>Aristotle's</i> iij. booke of Heaven: which kinde of figures
  <i>Aristotle</i> in the same place deemeth to bee onely ordinate, and yet
  not all of that kind. But only three among the Plaines, to witt a
  Triangle, a Quadrate, and a Sexangle: amongst Solids, two; the Pyramis,
  and the Cube. But if the filling of a place bee judged by right angles,
  4. in a Plaine, and 8. in a Solid, the Oblong of plaines, and the <!--
  Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>[49]</span>Octahedrum of Solids shall (as shall appeare
  in their places) fill a place; And yet is not this Geometrie of
  <i>Aristotle</i> accurate enough. But right angles doe determine this
  sentence, and so doth <i>Euclide</i> out of the angles demonstrate, That
  there are onely five ordinate solids; And so doth <i>Potamon</i> the
  Geometer, as <i>Simplicus</i> testifieth, demonstrate the question of
  figures filling a place. Lastly, if figures, by laying of their corners
  together, doe make in a Plaine 4. right angles, or in a Solid 8. they doe
  fill a place.</p>

  <p>Of this probleme the ancient geometers have written, as we heard even
  now: And of the latter writers, <i>Regiomontanus</i> is said to have
  written accurately; And of this argument <i>Maucolycus</i> hath promised
  a treatise, neither of which as yet it hath beene our good hap to
  see.</p>

  <p><i>Neither of these are figures of this nature, as in their due places
  shall be proved and demonstrated</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="28_e_iiij"></a> 28. <i>A round figure is that, all whose

  </div>
  <p>Such in plaines shall the Circle be, in Solids the Globe or Spheare.
  Now this figure, the Round, I meane, of all Isoperimeters is the
  greatest, as appeared before at the <a href="#15_e_iiij">15. e</a>. For
  which cause <i>Plato</i>, in his <i>Timæus</i> or his Dialogue of the
  World said; That this figure is of all other the greatest. And therefore
  God, saith he, did make the world of a <!-- Page 50 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>[50]</span>sphearicall forme, that
  within his compasse it might the better containe all things: And
  <i>Aristotle</i>, in his Mechanicall problems, saith; That this figure is
  the beginning, principle, and cause of all miracles. But those miracles
  shall in their time God willing, be manifested and showne.</p>

  <p><i>Rotundum</i>, a Roundle, let it be here used for <i>Rotunda
  figura</i>, a round figure. And in deede <i>Thomas Finkius</i> or
  <i>Finche</i>, as we would call him, a learned <i>Dane</i>, sequestring
  this argument from the rest of the body of Geometry, hath intituled that
  his worke <i>De Geometria rotundi</i>, Of the Geometry of the Round or
  roundle.</p>

  <p><a name="29_e_iiij"></a> 29. <i>The diameters of a roundle are cut in
  two by equall raies</i>.</p>

  <p>The reason is, because the halfes of the diameters, are the raies. Or
  because the diameter is nothing else but a doubled ray: Therefore if thou
  shalt cut off from the diameter so much, as is the radius or ray, it
  followeth that so much shall still remaine, as thou hast cutte of, to
  witt one ray, which is the other halfe of the diameter. <i>Sn</i>.</p>

  <p>And here observe, That <i>Bisecare</i>, doth here, and in other places
  following, signifie to cutte a thing into two equall parts or portions;
  And so <i>Bisegmentum</i>, to be one such portion; And <i>Bisectio</i>,
  such a like cutting or division.</p>

  Out of the 1. d. iij</i>.</p>

  <p>Circles and Spheares are equall, which have equall diameters. For the
  raies, which doe measure the space betweene the Center and Perimeter, are
  equall, of which, being doubled, the Diameter doth consist.

  <p><i>Lineatum</i>, (or <i>Lineamentum</i>) a magnitude made of lines, as
  was defined at <a href="#1_e_iij">1. e. iij</a>. is here divided into two
  kindes: which is easily conceived out of the said definition there, in
  which a line is excluded, and a Surface &amp; a body are comprehended.
  And from hence arose the division of the arte Metriall into Geometry, of
  a surface, and Stereometry, of a body, after which maner <i>Plato</i> in
  his vij. booke of his Common-wealth, and <i>Aristotle</i> in the 7.
  chapter of the first booke of his <i>Posteriorums</i>, doe distinguish
  betweene Geometry and Stereometry: And yet the name of Geometry is used
  to signifie the whole arte of measuring in generall.</p>

  <p>As here <i>aeio.</i> and <i>uysr.</i> The definition of a Surface doth
  comprehend the distance or dimension of a line, to <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>[52]</span>witt Length: But it
  addeth another distance, that is Breadth. <span class="correction"
  title="text reads `Therefoce'">Therefore</span> a Surface is defined by
  some, as <i>Proclus</i> saith, to be a magnitude of two dimensions. But
  two doe not so specially and so properly define it. Therefore a Surface
  is better defined, to bee a magnitude onely long and broad. Such, saith
  <i>Apollonius</i>, are the shadowes upon the earth, which doe farre and
  wide cover the ground and champion fields, and doe not enter into the
  earth, nor have any manner of thicknesse at all.</p>

  <p><i>Epiphania</i>, the Greeke word, which importeth onely the outter
  appearance of a thing, is here more significant, because of a Magnitude
  there is nothing visible or to bee seene, but the surface.</p>

  <p><a name="3_e_v"></a> 3. <i>The bound of a surface is a line. 6. d
  j</i>.</p>

  <p>The matter in Plaines is manifest. For a three cornered surface is
  bounded with 3. lines: A foure cornered surface, with foure lines, and so
  forth: A Circle is bounded with one line. But in a Sphearicall surface
  the matter is not so plaine: For it being whole, seemeth not to be
  bounded with a line. Yet if the manner of making of a Sphearicall
  surface, by the conversi&#x14D; or turning about of a semiperiphery, the
  beginning of it, as also the end, shalbe a line, to wit a semiperiphery:
  And as a point doth not only <i>actu</i>, or indeede bound and end a
  line: But is <i>potentia</i>, or in power, the middest of it: So also a
  line boundeth a Surface <i>actu</i>, and an innumerable company of lines
  may be taken or supposed to be throughout the whole surface. A Surface
  therefore is made by the motion of a line, as a Line was made by the
  motion of a point.</p>

  <p><a name="4_e_v"></a> 4. <i>A Surface is either Plaine or
  Bowed</i>.</p>

  <p>The difference of a Surface, doth answer to the difference of a Line,
  in straightnesse and obliquity or crookednesse.</p>

  <p><a name="6_e_v"></a> 6. <i>From a point unto a point we may, in a
  plaine surface, draw a right line, 1 and 2. post. j</i>.</p>

  <p>Three things are from the former ground begg'd: The first is of a
  Right line. A right line and a periphery were in the ij. booke defined:
  But the fabricke or making of them both, is here said to bee properly in
  a plaine.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/073b.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/073b.png"
      alt="Right Line." title="Right Line." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The fabricke or construction of a right line is the 1. petition. And
  justly is it required that it may bee done onely upon a plaine: For in
  any other surface it were in vaine to aske it. For neither may wee
  possibly in a sphericall betweene two points draw a right line: Neither
  may wee possibly in a Conicall and Cylindraceall betweene any two points
  assigned draw a right line. For from the toppe <!-- Page 54 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>[54]</span>unto the base that in
  these is only possible: And then is it the bounde of the plaine which
  cutteth the Cone and Cylinder. Therefore, as I said, of a right plaine it
  may onely justly bee demanded: That from any point assigned, unto any
  point assigned, a right line may be drawne, as here from <i>a</i> unto
  <i>e</i>.</p>

  <p>Now the Geometricall instrument for the drawing of a right plaine is
  called <i>Amussis</i>, &amp; by <i>Petolemey</i>, in the 2. chapter of
  his first booke of his Musicke, <i>Regula</i>, a Rular, such as heere
  thou seest.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:60%;">
      <a href="images/074.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/074.png"
      alt="Rular." title="Rular." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>And from a point unto a point is this justly demanded to be done, not
  unto points; For neither doe all points fall in a right line: But many
  doe fall out to be in a crooked line. And in a Spheare, a Cone &amp;
  Cylinder, a Ruler may be applyed, but it must be a sphearicall, Conicall,
  or Cylindraceall. But by the example of a right line doth
  <i>Vitellio</i>, 2 <i>p j.</i> demaund that betweene two lines a surface
  may be extended: And so may it seeme in the Elements, of many figures
  both plaine and solids, by <i>Euclide</i> to be demanded; That a figure
  may be described, at the 7. and 8. e ij. Item that a figure may be made
  vp, at the 8. 14. 16. 23. 28. p. vj. which are of Plaines. Item at the
  25. 31. 33. 34. 36. 49. p. xj. which are of Solids. Yet notwithstanding a
  plaine surface, and a plaine body doe measure their rectitude by a right
  line, so that <i>jus postulandi</i>, this right of begging to have a
  thing granted may seeme primarily to bee in a right plaine line.</p>

  <p>Now the <i>Continuation</i> of a right line is nothing else, but the
  drawing out farther of a line now drawne, and that from a point unto a
  point, as we may continue the right line <i>ae.</i> unto <i>i.</i>
  wherefore the first and second Petitions of <i><span class="correction"

  of a right line: so also may the same <i>Rular</i>, used after another
  manner, be the instrument to describe or draw a periphery withall. And
  indeed such is that instrument used by the Coopers (and other like
  artists) for the rounding of their bottomes of their tubs, heads of
  barrells and otherlike vessells: But the <i>Compasses</i>, whether
  straight shanked or bow-legg'd, such as here thou seest, it skilleth not,
  are for al purposes and practises, in this case the best and readiest.
  And in deed the Compasses, of all <!-- Page 57 --><span

  are the most excellent, and by whose help famous Geometers have taught:
  That all the problems of geometry may bee wrought and performed: And
  there is a booke extant, set out by <i>John Baptist</i>, an Italian,
  teaching, How by one opening of the Compasses all the problems of
  <i>Euclide</i> may be resolved: And <i>Jeronymus Cardanus</i>, a famous
  Mathematician, in the 15. booke of his Subtilties, writeth, that there
  was by the helpe of the Compasses a demonstration of all things
  demonstrated by <i>Euclide</i>, found out by him and one
  <i>Ferrarius</i>.</p>

  doth fall upon the middle of the base; it shall shew that the length is

  </div>
  <p>The paralillesme, or parallell-equality of right lines cut with a
  right line, concludeth a threefold equality of angles: And the same is
  againe of each of them concluded. Therefore in this one element there are
  sixe things taught; all which are manifest if a perpendicular, doe fall
  <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>[65]</span>upon two parallell lines. The first sort of
  angles are in their owne words plainely enough expressed. But the word
  <i>Alternum</i>, alterne [or <i>alternate</i>, <i>H.</i>] here, as
  <i>Proclus</i> saith, signifieth situation, which in Arithmeticke
  signified proportion, when the antecedent was compared to the consequent;
  notwithstanding the metaphor answereth fitly. For as an acute angle is
  unto his successively following obtuse; So on the other part is the acute
  unto his successively following obtuse: Therefore alternly, As the acute
  unto the acute: so is the obtuse, unto the obtuse. But the outter and
  inner are opposite, of the which the one is without the parallels; the
  other is within on the same part not successively; but upon the same
  right line the third from the outer.</p>

  <p>The cause of this threefold propriety is from the perpendicular or
  plumb-line, which falling upon the parallells breedeth and discovereth
  all this variety: As here they are right angles which are the inner on
  the same part or side: Item, the alterne angles: Item the inner and the
  outter: And therefore they are equall, both, I meane, the two inner to
  two right angles: and the alterne angles between themselvs: And the
  outter to the inner opposite to it.</p>

  <p>If so be that the cutting line be oblique, that is, fall not upon them
  plumbe or perpendicularly, the same shall on the contrary befall the
  parallels. For by that same obliquation or slanting, the right lines
  remaining and the angles unaltered, in like manner both one of the inner,
  to wit, <i>euy</i>, is made obtuse, the other, to wit, <i>uyo</i>, is
  made acute: And the alterne angles are made acute and obtuse: As also the
  outter and inner opposite are likewise made acute and obtuse.</p>

  <p>If any man shall notwithstanding say, That the inner angles are
  unequall to two right angles: By the same argument may he say (saith
  <i>Ptolome</i> in <i>Proclus</i>) That on each side they be both greater
  than two right angles, and also lesser: As in the parallel right lines
  <i>ae</i> and <i>io</i>, cut with <!-- Page 66 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>[66]</span>the right line <i>uy</i>,
  if thou shalt say that <i>auy</i> and <i>iyu</i>, are greater then two
  right angles, the angles on the other side, by the <a href="#16_e_v">16
  e</a>, shall be lesser then two right angles, which selfesame
  notwithstanding are also, by the gainesayers graunt, greater then two
  right angles, which is impossible.</p>

      <a href="images/086a.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/086a.png"
      alt="Line crossing Parallel lines." title="Line crossing Parallel lines." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The same impossibility shall be concluded, if they shall be sayd, to
  be lesser than two right angles.</p>

  <p>The second and third parts may be concluded out of the first. The
  second is thus: Twise two angles are equall to two right angles
  <i>oyu</i>, and <i>euy</i>, by the former part: Item, <i>auy</i>, and
  <i>euy</i>, by the <a href="#14_e_v">14 e</a>. Therefore they are equall
  betweene themselves. Now from the equall, Take away <i>euy</i>, the
  common angle, And the remainders, the alterne angles, at <i>u</i>, and
  <i>y</i> shall be least equall.</p>

  <p>The third is thus: The angles <i>euy</i>, and <i>oys</i>, are equall
  to the same <i>uyi</i>, by the second propriety, and by the <a
  href="#15_e_v">15 e</a>. Therefore they are equall betweene
  themselves.</p>

  <p>The converse of the first is here also the more manifest by that light
  of the common perpendicular, And if any man shall thinke, That although
  the two inner angles be equall to two right angles, yet the right may
  meete, as if those equall angles were right angles, as here; it must
  needes be that two right lines divided by a common perpendicular, should
  both leane, the one this way, the other that way, or at least one of
  them, contrary to the <a href="#13_e_ij">13 e ij</a>.</p>

      alt="Converse cases." title="Converse cases." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>If they be oblique angles, as here, the lines one slanting or <!--
  Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page67"></a>[67]</span>obliquely crossing one another, the angles
  on one side will grow lesse, on the other side greater. Therefore they
  would not be equall to two right angles, against the graunt.</p>

  <p>From hence the second and third parts may be concluded. The second is
  thus: The alterne angles at <i>u</i> and <i>y</i>, are equall to the
  foresayd inner angles, by the 14 e: Because both of them are equall to
  the two right angles: And so by the first part the second is
  concluded.</p>

  <p>The third is therefore by the second demonstrated, because the outter
  <i>oys</i>, is equall to the verticall or opposite angle at the top, by
  the <a href="#15_e_v">15 e</a>. Therefore seeing the outter and inner
  opposite are equall, the alterne also are equall.</p>

  <p>Wherefore as <i>Parallelismus</i>, parallell-equality argueth a
  three-fold equality of angles: So the threefold equality of angles doth
  argue the same parallel-equality.</p>

  <p>This element might have beene concluded out of the next precedent: But
  it may also be learned out of those <!-- Page 70 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>[70]</span>which went before. As let
  <i>ae</i>, and <i>io</i>, equall parallels be bounded joyntly of
  <i>ai</i>, and <i>eo</i>: and let <i>ei</i> be drawn. Here because the
  right line <i>ei</i> falleth upon the parallels <i>ae</i>, and <i>io</i>,
  the alterne angles <i>aei</i> and <i>eio</i>, are equall, by the <a
  href="#21_e_v">21 e</a>. And they are equall in shankes <i>ae</i>, and
  <i>io</i>, by the grants, and <i>ei</i>, is the common shanke: Therefore
  they are also equall in base <i>ai</i>, and <i>eo</i>, by the <a
  href="#7_e_iij">7 e iij</a>. This is the first: Then by <a
  href="#21_e_v">21 e</a>, the alterne angles <i>eia</i>, and <i>ieo</i>,
  are equall betweene themselves: And those are made by <i>ai</i> and
  <i>eo</i>, cut by the right line <i>ei</i>: Therefore they are parallell;
  which was the second.</p>

  <p>Thus much of the Perpendicle, and parallell equality of plaine right
  lines: Their Proportion is the last thing to be considered of them.</p>

  <p>The truth of this element dependeth upon the nature of the parallells:
  And that throughout all kindes of equality and inequality, both greater
  and lesser. For if the lines thus cut be perpendiculars, the portions
  <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>[71]</span>intercepted betweene the two parallels shall
  be equall: for common perpendiculars doe make parallell equality, as
  before hath beene taught, and here thou seest.</p>

  <p>If the lines cut be not parallels, but doe leane one toward another,
  the portions cut or intercepted betweene them will not be equall, yet
  shall they be proportionall one to another. And looke how much greater
  the line thus cut is: so much greater shall the intersegments or portions

  <p>A squire (<i>Norma</i>, <i>Gnomon</i>, or <i>Canon</i>) is an
  instrument consisting of two shankes, including a right angle. Of this we
  heard before at the <a href="#13_e_v">13. e</a>. By the meanes of this a

  may also be called a <i>Mesolabium</i>, or <i>Mesographus simplex</i>, or
  single meane finder.</p>

  <p>Let the two right lines given, be <i>ae</i>, and <i>ei</i>. The meane
  proportional between these two is desired. For the finding of which, let
  it be granted that as <i>ae</i>, is to <i>eo</i>, so <i>eo</i>, is to
  <i>ei</i>: therefore let <i>ae</i>, be continued or drawne out unto
  <i>i</i>, so that <i>ei</i>, be equall to the other given. Then from

  his angle it may comprehend at <i>eo</i>, and with his shanks it may
  include the whole right line <i>ai</i>. I say that <i>eo</i>, the segment
  of the perpendicular, is the meane proportionall between <!-- Page 77
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>[77]</span><i>ae</i>, and
  <i>ei</i>, the two lines given. For let <i>ea</i>, be continued or drawne

  <i>eo</i>: and unto <i>a</i>, the point of the continuation, let the
  angle <i>uas</i>, be made equall, and equicrurall to the angle
  <i>oei</i>, that is, let the shanke <i>as</i>, be made equall to the

  the right lines <i>us</i>, and <i>oi</i>, shall be equall; and the angles
  <i>eoi</i>, <i>aus</i>, by the <a href="#7_e_iij">7. e iij</a>. And by
  the <a href="#21_e_v">21. e</a>, the lines <i>sa</i>, and <i>oe</i>, are
  parallell: and the angle <i>sao</i>, is equall to the angle <i>aoe</i>.
  But the angles <i>sae</i>, and <i>aoi</i>, are right angles by the
  Fabricke and by the grant; and therefore they are equall, by the <a
  href="#14_e_iij">14. e iij</a>. Wherefore the other angles <i>oae</i>,

  sides <i>au</i>, moueable, or to be done up and downe, by an hollow
  riglet in the side adjoyning. Therefore thou shalt make thee a
  Mesographus, if unto the squire thou doe adde one moveable side, but so
  that how so ever it be moved, it be still parallell unto the opposite
  side [which is nothing else, but as it were a double squire, if this
  squire be applied unto it; and indeed what is done by this instrument,
  may also be done by two squires, as hereafter shall be shewed.] And so
  long and oft must the moveable side be moved up and downe, untill with
  the opposite side it containe or touch the ends of the assigned, but the
  angles must fall precisely upon the continued lines: The right lines from
  the point of the continuation, unto the corners of the squire, are the
  two meane proportionals sought.</p>

  <p>As if of the Mesographus <i>auoi</i>, the moveable side be <i>au</i>;

  ends of the assigned <i>a</i>, and <i>i</i>. By the former consectary it
  shall be as <i>ei</i>, is to <i>eo</i>, so <i>eo</i>, shall be unto

  <i>uy</i>, <i>in</i>, <i>ey</i>, by the 32. e: <i>ye</i>, <i>eo</i>,
  <i>ey</i>, <i>eo</i>. Therefore as the product of <i>iu</i>, by

Of the comparison of Triangles.</h2>

  <p><a name="1_e_vij"></a> 1. <i>Equilater triangles are equiangles. 8. p.
  j</i>.</p>

  <p>Thus forre of the Geometry, or affections and reason of one triangle;
  the comparison of two triangles one with another doth follow. And first
  of their rate or reason, out of their sides and angles: Whereupon
  triangles betweene themselves are said to be equilaters and equiangles.
  First out of the equality of the sides, is drawne also the equalitie of
  the angles.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:40%;">

      alt="Equilater triangles." title="Equilater triangles." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>Triangles therefore are here jointly called equilaters, whose sides
  are severally equall, the first to the first, the second, to the second,
  the third to the third; although every severall triangle be
  inequilaterall. Therefore the equality of the sides doth argue the
  equality of the angles, by the <a href="#7_e_iij">7. e iij</a>. As
  here.</p>

  <p><a name="2_e_vij"></a> 2. <i>If two triangles be equall in angles,
  either the two equicrurals, or two of equall either shanke, or base of
  two angles, they are equilaters, 4. and 26. p j</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="correction" title="text reads `Oh'">Or</span> thus; If
  two triangles be equall in their angles, either <!-- Page 95 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>[95]</span>in two angles contained
  under equall feet, or in two angles, whose side or base of both is
  equall, those angles are equilater. <i>H</i>.</p>

  <p>This element hath three parts, or it doth conclude two triangles to be
  equilaters three wayes. 1. The first part is apparent thus: Let the two
  triangles be <i>aei</i>, and <i>ouy</i>; because the equall angles at
  <i>a</i>, and <i>o</i>, are equicrurall, therefore they are equall in
  base, by the <a href="#7_e_iij">7. e iij</a>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:40%;">

      alt="Equilater triangles: equicrural equal angles." title="Equilater triangles: equicrural equal angles." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>2 The second thus: Let the said two triangles <i>aei</i>, and
  <i>ouy</i>, be equall in two angles a peece, at <i>e</i>, and <i>i</i>,
  and at <i>u</i>, and <i>y</i>. And let them be equall in the shanke
  <i>ei</i>, to <i>uy</i>. I say, they are equilaters. For if the side
  <i>ae</i>, (for examples sake) be greater than the side <i>ou</i>, let
  <i>es</i>, be cut off equall unto it; and draw the right line <i>is</i>.
  Here by the antecedent, the triangles <i>sei</i>, and <i>ouy</i>, shall
  be equiangles, and the angles <i>sie</i>, shall be equall to the angle
  <i>oyu</i>, to which <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page96"></a>[96]</span>also the whole angle <i>aie</i>, is equall,
  by the grant. Therefore the whole and the part are equall, which is
  impossible. Wherefore the side <i>ae</i>, is not unequall but equall to
  the side <i>ou</i>: And by the antecedent or former part, the triangles
  <i>aei</i>, and <i>ouy</i>, being equicrurall, are equall, at the angle
  of the shanks: Therefore also they are equall in their bases <i>ai</i>,
  and <i>oy</i>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:40%;">
      <a href="images/117.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/117.png"
      alt="Equilater triangles: two equal angles and equal shank." title="Equilater triangles: two equal angles and equal shank." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>3 The third part is thus forced: In the triangles <i>aei</i>, and
  <i>ouy</i>, let the angles at <i>e</i>, and <i>i</i>, and <i>u</i>, and
  <i>y</i>, be equall, as afore: And <i>ae</i>, the base of the angle at
  <i>i</i>, be equall to <i>ou</i>, the base of angle at <i>y</i>: I say
  that the two triangles given are equilaters. For if the side <i>ei</i>,
  be greater than the side <i>uy</i>, let <i>es</i>, be cut off equall to
  it, and draw the right line <i>as</i>. Therefore by the antecedent, the
  two triangles, <i>aes</i>, and <i>ouy</i>, equall in the angle of their
  equall shankes are equiangle: And the angle <i>ase</i>, is equall to the
  angle <i>oyu</i>, which is equall by the grant unto the angle <i>aie</i>.
  Therefore <i>ase</i>, is equall to <i>aie</i>, the outter to the inner,
  contrary to the <a href="#15_e_vj">15. e. vj</a>. Therefore the base
  <i>ei</i>, is not unequall to the base <i>uy</i>, but equall. And
  therefore as above was said, the two triangles <i>aei</i>, and
  <i>ouy</i>, equall in the angle of their equall shankes, are
  equilaters.</p>

  <p><a name="3_e_vij"></a> 3. <i>Triangles are equall in their three
  angles</i>.</p>

  <p>The reason is, because the three angles in any triangle are <!-- Page
  97 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>[97]</span>equall to two
  right angles, by the <a href="#13_e_vj">13. e vj</a>. As here, the
  greatest triangle, all his corners joyntly taken, is equall to the
  least.</p>

  <p>And yet notwithstanding it is not therefore to be thought to be
  equiangle to it: For Triangles are then equiangles, when the severall
  angles of the one, are equall to the severall angles of the other: Not
  when all joyntly are equall to all.</p>

  <p>Direct proportion in triangles, is such as hath in the former beene
  taught: Reciprocall proportion followeth. It is a consectary drawne out
  of the <a href="#18_e_iiij">18 e iiij</a>; which is manifest, as oft as
  the equall angle is a right angle: For then those shankes, [comprehending
  the equall angles,] are the heights and the bases; As here thou seest in
  the severed triangles. Notwithstanding in obliquangle triangles, although
  the shankes are not the heights, the cause of the truth hereof is the
  same. Yet if any man shall desire a demonstration of it, it is thus: Let
  therefore the diagramme or figure bee in the triangles <i>aei</i>, and
  <i>aou</i>: And the angles <i>oau</i>, and <i>eai</i>, let them be
  equall: And as <i>ua</i> is to <i>ae</i>, so let <i>ia</i> be unto
  <i>ao</i>: I say that the triangles <i>aou</i>, and <i>eai</i>, are
  equall. For <i>eo</i> being knit together with a right line, <i>uao</i>
  is unto <i>oae</i>, as <i>ua</i> is unto <i>ae</i>, by the 7 e: <!-- Page
  101 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>[101]</span>And
  <i>ia</i>, unto <i>ao</i>, by the grant, is as <i>eai</i> is unto
  <i>eao</i>. Therefore <i>uao</i>, and <i>eai</i>, are unto <i>eao</i>
  proportionall: And therefore they are equall one to another.</p>

  <p>The converse, is concluded by the same sorites, but by saying all
  backward. For <i>ua</i> unto <i>ae</i> is, as <i>uao</i> is unto
  <i>oae</i>, by the 7 e: And as <i>eai</i>, by the grant: Because they are
  equall: And as <i>ia</i> is unto <i>ao</i>, by the same, Wherefore
  <i>ua</i> is unto <i>ae</i>, as <i>ia</i> is unto <i>ao</i>.</p>

  are proportionall in shankes: And contrariwise: 4 and 5.</i> <i>p.
  vj</i>.</p>

  <p>The comparison both of the rate and proportion of triangles hath in
  the former beene taught: Their similitude remaineth for the last place.
  Which similitude of theirs consisteth indeed of the reason, or rate of
  their angles and proportion of the shankes. Therefore for just cause was
  the reason of the angles set first: Because from thence not onely their
  reason, but also their latter proportion is gathered. Let <i>aei</i> and
  <i>iou</i>, be two triangles equiangled: And let them be set upon the
  same line <i>eiu</i>, meeting or touching one another in the common point
  <i>i</i>. Then, seeing that the angles at <i>e</i> and <i>i</i>, are
  granted to bee equall, the lines <i>oi</i>, and <i>ae</i>, are parallel,
  by the <a href="#21_e_v">21 e v</a>. Therefore by the <a
  href="#22_e_v">22 e v</a> <i>uo</i> and <i>ea</i>, being continued, shall
  meete. Item, The right lines <i>ai</i>, and <i>yu</i>, by the <a
  href="#21_e_v">21 e v</a>, are parallel, because the angle <i>aie</i> is
  equall to <i>oui</i>, the inner opposite to it. Therefore seeing that
  <i>ai</i> is parallell to the base <i>yu</i>, by the <a href="#21_e_v">21
  e v</a>, <i>ea</i> shall be to <i>ay</i>, that is, by the <a
  href="#26_e_v">26 e v</a>, to <i>io</i>, as <i>ei</i> is to <i>iu</i>:
  And alternly, or crosse wayes, <i>ea</i> shall be to <i>ei</i>, as
  <i>io</i> is to <i>iu</i>. This is the first proportion. Item, <!-- Page
  102 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>[102]</span>seeing
  that <i>io</i> is parallell to the base <i>ye</i>; <i>yo</i>, that is, by
  the <a href="#26_e_v">26 e v</a>, <i>ai</i> shall bee unto <i>ou</i>, as
  <i>ei</i>, is unto <i>iu</i>: And crosse wise, as <i>ai</i> is unto
  <i>ie</i>, so is <i>ou</i> unto <i>ui</i>. This is the second
  proposition. Lastly, equiordinately: <i>ae</i> is to <i>ai</i>, as
  <i>oi</i> is to <i>ou</i>: wherefore if triangles be equiangled, they are
  proportional in shankes.</p>

  </div>
  <p>This converse is thus demonstrated. Let there be two triangles
  <i>aei</i>, and <i>ouy</i>, proportionall in shankes: And as <i>ae</i> is
  to <i>ei</i>; so let <i>ou</i>, be to <i>uy</i>: And as <i>ai</i> is to
  <i>ie</i>; so let <i>oy</i> bee to <i>yu</i>. Then at the points <i>u</i>
  and <i>y</i>, let angles be made by the <a href="#11_e_iij">11 e iij</a>.
  equall to the angles at <i>e</i> and <i>i</i>, and let the triangle
  <i>uys</i>, be made: for the other angles at <i>a</i> and <i>s</i>, shall
  be equall by the <a href="#4_e_vij">4 e</a>. And the triangle <i>yus</i>,
  shall be equiangled to the assigned <i>aei</i>. And by the antecedent, it
  shall be proportionall to it in shankes. Thus are two triangles
  <i>ouy</i>, by the grant; and <i>uys</i>, by the construction,
  proportionall in shanks to the same triangle <i>aei</i>: And as
  <i>ae</i>, is to <i>ei</i>, so is <i>ou</i>, to <i>uy</i>; so is
  <i>su</i>, to <i>uy</i>. Therefore seeing <i>ou</i> and <i>su</i>, are
  proportionall to the same <i>yu</i>, they are equall; Item, as <i>ai</i>
  is to <i>ie</i>: so is <i>oy</i> unto <i>yu</i>: so also is <i>sy</i>
  unto <i>yu</i>. Therefore <i>oy</i> and <i>sy</i>, seeing they are
  proportionall to the same <i>yu</i>, are equall. (<i>yu</i> is the common
  side.) The triangle therefore <i>ouy</i>, is equilater unto the triangle
  <i>syu</i>. And by the <a href="#1_e_vij">1 e</a>, it is to it equiangle:
  And therefore it is equiangled to the triangle <i>aei</i>, which was to
  be prooved. This was generally before taught at the <a

  <p>The Converse is thus proved: Let the triangle be <i>aei</i>: And let
  the perpendicular <i>eo</i>, be erected upon <i>ae</i>, equall to
  <i>ei</i>: And draw a right line from <i>o</i> to <i>a</i>: Here by the

  rightilineall at <i>ao</i>, made alike and situate alike: And by the
  graunt they are equall, to the rectilineall at <i>ai</i>, made alike and

  <i>ai</i>, are equall; they have by the <a href="#20_e_iiij">20 e

  equiliters: And by the <a href="#1_e_vij">1 e vij</a>, equiangles. But
  <i>aeo</i>, is a right angle, by the construction: And <i>aei</i>, is

  <p>The division of an obliquangled triangle is taken from the speciall

<h2>The ninth Booke, of <i>P. Ramus</i>
Geometry, which intreateth of
the measuring of right lines
by like right-angled
<i>triangles</i>.</h2>

  <p>The Geometry of like right-angled triangles, amongst many other uses
  that it hath, it doth especially afford us the geodæsy or measuring of
  right lines: And that mastery, which before (at the <a href="#2_e_viij">2
  e viij</a>) attributed the right angled triangles, shall here be found to
  be a true mastery indeed. <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page114"></a>[114]</span>For it shall containe the geodesy of right
  lines; and afterward the geodesy of plaines and solides, by the measuring
  of their sides, which are right lines.</p>

  <p><a name="1_e_ix"></a> 1. <i>For the measuring of right lines; we will
  use the</i> Iacobs <i>staffe, which is a squire of unequall
  shankes</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Radius</i>, commonly called <i>Baculus Iacob</i>, <i>Iacobs</i>
  staffe, as if it had been long since invented and practised by that holy
  Patriarke, is a very auncient instrument, and of all other Geometricall
  instruments, commonly used, the best and fittest for this use.
  <i>Archimedes</i> in his book of the Number of the sand, seemeth to
  mention some such thing: And <i>Hipparchus</i>, with an instrument not
  much unlike this, boldly attempted an haynous matter in the sight of God,
  as <i>Pliny</i> thinketh, namely to deliver unto posterity the number of
  the starres, and to assigne or fixe them in their true places by the
  <i>Norma</i>, the squire or <i>Iacobs</i> staffe. And indeed true it is
  that the Radius is not onely used for the measuring of the earth and
  land: But especially for the defining or limiting of the starres in their
  places and order: And for the describing and setting out of all the
  regions and waies of the heavenly city. Yea and <i>Virgill</i> the famous
  Poet, in his 3 <i>Ecloge</i>, <i>Ecquis fuit alter</i>, <i>Descripsit
  radio totum</i>, <i>qui gentibus orbem?</i> and againe afterward in the 6
  of his <i>Eneiades</i>, hath noted both these uses. <i>C&oelig;liquè
  meatus.</i> <i>Describent radio &amp; surgentia sidera dicent.</i> Long
  after this the <i>Iewes</i> and <i>Arabians</i>, as <i>Rabbi Levi</i>;
  But in these latter daies, the <i>Germaines</i> especially, as
  <i>Regiomontanus</i>; <i>Werner</i>, <i>Schoner</i>, and <i>Appian</i>
  have grac'd it: But above all other the learned <i>Gemma Phrisius</i> in
  a severall worke of that argument onely, hath illustrated and taught the
  use of it plainely and fully.</p>

  <p>The <i>Iacobs</i> staffe therefore according to his owne, and those
  Geometricall parts, shall here be described (The <!-- Page 115 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page115"></a>[115]</span>astronomicall
  distribution wee reserve to his time and place.) And that done, the use
  of it shall be shewed in the measuring of lines.</p>

  <p>This instrument, at the discretion of the measurer may be greater or
  lesser. For the quantity of the same can no otherwayes be determined.</p>

  <p><a name="2_e_ix"></a> 2. <i>The shankes of the staffe are the Index
  and the Transome</i>.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The principall parts of this instrument are two, the <i>Index</i>, or
  <i>Staffe</i>, which is the greater or longer part: and the
  <i>Transversarium</i>, or Transome, and is the lesser and shorter.</p>

  <p><a name="3_e_ix"></a> 3. <i>The Index is the double and one tenth part
  of the transome</i>.</p>

  <p>Or thus: The Index is to the transversary double and 1/10 part
  thereof. <i>H.</i> As here thou seest.</p>

  <p><a name="4_e_ix"></a> 4. <i>The Transome is that which rideth upon the
  Index, and is to be slid higher or lower at pleasure</i>.</p>

  <p>Or, The transversary is to be moved upon the Index, sometimes higher,
  sometimes lower: <i>H.</i> This proportion in defining and making of the
  shankes of the instrument is perpetually to be observed: as if the
  transome be 10. parts, the <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page116"></a>[116]</span>Index must be 21. If that be 189. this
  shall be 90. or if it be 2000. this shall be 4200. Neither doth it skill
  what the numbers be, so this be their proportion. More than this, That
  the greater the numbers be, that is the lesser that the divisions be, the
  better will it be in the use. And because the Index must beare, and the
  transome is to be borne; let the index be thicker, and the transome the
  thinner.</p>

  </div>
  <p>But of what matter each part of the staffe be made, whether of brasse
  or wood it skilleth not, so it be firme, and will not cast or warpe.
  Notwithstanding, the transome will more conveniently be moved up and
  downe by brasen pipes, both by it selfe, and upon the Index higher or
  lower right angle wise, so touching one another, that the alterne mouth
  of the one may touch the side of the other. The thrid pipe is to be moved
  or slid up and downe, from one end of the transome to the other; and
  therefore it may be called the <i>Cursor</i>. The fourth and fifth pipes,
  fixed and immoveable, are set upon the ends of the transome, are <!--
  Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>[117]</span>unto
  the third and second of equall height with finnes, to restraine when
  neede is, the opticke line, and as it were, with certaine points to
  define it in the transome.</p>

  <p>The three first pipes may, as occasion shall require, be fastened or
  staied with brasen scrues. With these pipes therefore the transome may be
  made as great, as need shall require, as here thou seest.</p>

  <p>The fabricke or manner of making the instrument hath hitherto beene
  taught, the use thereof followeth: unto which in generall is required:
  First, a just distance. For the sight is not infinite. Secondly, that one
  eye be closed: For the optick faculty conveighed from both the eyes into
  one, doth aime more certainely; and the instrument is more fitly applied
  and set to the cheeke bone, then to any other place. For here the eye is
  as it were the center of the circle, into which the transome is
  inscribed. Thirdly, the hands must be steady; for if they shake, the
  proportion of the Geodesy must needes be troubled and uncertaine. Lastly,
  the place of the station is from the midst of the foote.</p>

  <p><a name="5_e_ix"></a> 5. <i>If the sight doe passe from the beginning
  of one shanke, it passeth by the end of the other: And the one shanke is
  perpendicular unto the magnitude to be measured, the other
  parallell</i>.</p>

  <p>These common and generall things are premised. That the sight is from
  the beginning of the Index by the end of the transome; Or contrariwise,
  From the beginning of the transome, unto the end of the Index. And that
  the Index is right, that is, perpendicular to the line to be measured,
  the transome parallell. Or contrariwise. Now the perpendicularity of the
  Index, in measurings of lengthts, may be tried by a plummet of lead
  appendent; But in heights and breadths, the eye must be trusted; although
  a little varying of the plummet can make no sensible errour. <!-- Page
  118 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>[118]</span>By the end
  of the transome, understand that which is made by the line visuall,
  whether it be the outmost finne, or the Cursour in any other place
  whatsoever.</p>

  <p><a name="6_e_ix"></a> 6. <i>Length and Altitude have a threefold
  measure; The first and second kinde of measure require but one distance,
  and that by granting a dimension of one of them, for the third
  proportionall: The third two distances, and such onely is the dimension
  of Latitude</i>.</p>

  <p>Geodesy of right lines is two fold; of one distance, or of two.
  Geodesy of one distance is when the measurer for the finding of the
  desired dimension doth not change his place of standing. Geodesy of two
  distances is when the measurer by reason of some impediment lying in the
  way betweene him and the magnitude to be measured, is constrained to
  change his place, and make a double standing.</p>

  <p>Here observe, That length and heighth, may be joyntly measured both
  with one, and with a double station: But breadth may not be measured
  otherwise than with two.</p>

  <p><a name="7_e_ix"></a> 7. <i>If the sight be from the beginning of the
  Index right or plumbe unto the length, and unto the farther end of the
  same, as the segment of the Index is, unto the segment of the transome,
  so is the heighth of the measurer unto the length</i>.</p>

  <p>Let therefore the segment of the Index, from the toppe, I meane, unto
  the transome be 6. parts. The segment of the transome, to wit, from the

  of the measurer, 4. foote: The length, by the rule of three, shall be 12.
  foote. The figure is thus, for as <i>ae</i>, is to <i>ei</i>, so is
  <i>ao</i>, <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <i>aei</i>, and <i>aou</i>, are right angles: And that which is at

  <p>The same manner of measuring shall be used from an higher place; as

  <p>Thus mayest thou measure the breadths of Rivers, Valleys, and Ditches.
  For the Length is alwayes after this manner, so that one may measure the

  <p>Hereafter in the measuring of Longitude and Altitude, sight is unto
  the toppe of the heighth. Which here I doe now forewarne thee of, least
  afterward it should in vaine be reitered often.</p>

  <p>The second manner of measuring a Length is thus: <!-- Page 121
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>[121]</span></p>

  <p><a name="8_e_ix"></a> 8. <i>If the sight be from the beginning of the
  index parallell to the length to be measured, as the segment of the
  transome is, unto the segment of the index, so shall the heighth given be
  to the length</i>.</p>

  <p>As if the segment of the Transome be 120 parts: the height given 400
  foote: The segment of the Index 210 parts: The length, by the golden rule
  shall be 700 foote. The figure is thus. And the demonstration is like
  unto the former; or indeed more easier. For the triangles are equiangles,
  as afore. Therefore as <i>ou</i> is to <i>ua</i>: so is <i>ei</i> to
  <i>ia</i>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:55%;">
      <a href="images/142.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/142.png"
      alt="Using Iacobs staffe in the second kinde." title="Using Iacobs staffe in the second kinde." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>This is the first and second kinde of measuring of a Longitude, by one
  single distance or station: The third which is by a double distance doth
  now follow. Here the transome, if there be roome enough for the measurer
  to goe farre enough backe, must be put lower, in the second distance.</p>

  <p><a name="9_e_ix"></a> 9. <i>If the sight be from the beginning of the
  <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page122"></a>[122]</span>transverie parallell to the length to be
  measured, as in the index the difference of the greater segment is unto
  the lesser; so is the difference of the second station unto the
  length</i>.</p>

  <p>This kinde of Geodæsy is somewhat more subtile than the former were.
  The figure is thus; in which let the first ayming be from <i>a</i>, the
  beginning of the transome, and out of <i>ai</i> the length sought by
  <i>o</i>, the end of the Index, unto <i>e</i>, the toppe of the heighth:
  And let the segment of the Index be <i>ou</i>: The second ayming let it
  be from <i>y</i>, the beginning of the transome, out of a greater
  distance by <i>s</i>, the end of the Index, unto <i>e</i>, the same note
  of the heighth: And let the segment of the Index be <i>sr</i>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:55%;">

      alt="Using Iacobs staffe at two distances." title="Using Iacobs staffe at two distances." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>Here the measuring performed, is the taking of the difference betweene
  <i>ou</i> and <i>sr</i>. The rest are faigned onely for demonstrations
  sake. Therefore in the first station let <i>aml</i>, be from the
  beginning of the transome, be parallell to <i>ye</i>. Here first
  <i>mu</i>, is equall to <i>sr</i>. For the triangles <!-- Page 123
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>[123]</span><i>mua</i>,
  and <i>sry</i>, are equall in their shankes <i>ua</i>, and <i>ry</i>, by
  the grant (Because the transome standeth still in his owne place:) And
  the angles at <i>mua</i>, <i>uam</i>, are equall to the angles: And all
  right angles are equall, by the <a href="#14_e_iij">14 e iij</a>. These
  are the outter and inner opposite one to another: And such are equall by
  the <span class="correction" title="wrong reference but I cannot deduce the correction."
  >1 e v</span>. Therefore they are equilaters, by the <a href="#2_e_vij">2
  e vij</a>; And <i>om</i>, is the difference of the segments of the Index.
  Then as <i>om</i> is to <i>mu</i>, so is <i>el</i>, to <i>li</i>; as the
  equation of three degrees doth shew. For, by the <a href="#12_e_vij">12 e
  vij</a>, as <i>om</i> is to <i>ma</i>: so is <i>el</i> to <i>la</i>: And
  as <i>ma</i> is to <i>mu</i>; so is <i>la</i>, to <i>li</i>. Therefore by
  right, as <i>om</i>, is to <i>mu</i>: so is <i>el</i>, to <i>li</i>: And
  by the <a href="#12_e_vj">12 e vj</a>, so is <i>ya</i>, to <i>ai</i>: As
  if the difference of the first segment be 36 parts: The second segment be
  72 parts: The difference of the second station 40 foote. The length
  sought shall be 80 foote. And here indeed is no heighth definitely given,
  that may make any bound of the principall proportion. Notwithstanding the
  Heighth, although it be of an unknowne measure, is the bound of the
  length sought: And therefore it is an helpe and meanes to argue the
  question. Because it is conceived to stand plumbe upon the outmost end of
  the length.</p>

  <p>Therefore that third kinde of measuring of length is oftentimes
  necessary, when by neither of the former wayes the length may possibly be
  taken, by reason of some impediment in the way, to wit of a wall, or
  tree, or house, or mountaine, whereby the end of the length may not be
  seene, which was the first way: Nor an height next adjoyning to the end
  of the length is given, which is the second way.</p>

  <p>Hitherto we have spoken of the threefold measure of longitude, the
  first and second out of an heighth given the third cut of a double
  distance: The measuring of heighth followeth next, and that is also
  threefold. Now heighth is a perpendicular line falling from the toppe of
  the magnitude, unto the ground or plaine whereon the measurer doth stand,
  after which manner Altitude or <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Let the segment of the transome be 60 parts: the segment of the Index

  <p>The second station might have beene in <i>o</i>, the end of the

  <p>One may againe also out of the toppe of a Turret measure the distance
  of two turrets one from another: For it is the first manner of measuring

  the yard is hang'd without the heighth given. The figure is thus: And the

  <p>First the Diagonall is defined: As in the whole parallelogramme
  <i>aeio</i>, the diagonals are <i>auys</i>, and <i>ylir</i>; Because they
  are parts of the whole, having both the same common angles at <i>a</i>,
  and <i>i</i>: and diagonall diameter <i>ai</i>, with the whole
  parallelogramme: Not that the whole diagonie is common to both: But
  because the particular diagonies are the parts of the whole diagony.
  Therefore the diagonalls are two.</p>

  <p><a name="17_e_x"></a> 17 <i>The Diagonall is like, and alike situate
  to the whole parallelogramme: è 24. p vj</i>.</p>

  <p>There is not any, either rate or proportion of the diagonall
  propounded, onely similitude is attributed to it, as in the same figure,
  the Diagonall <i>auys</i>, is like unto the whole parallelogramme
  <i>aeio</i>. For first it is equianglar to it. For the angle at <i>a</i>,
  is common to them both: And that is equall to that which is at <i>y</i>,
  (by the <a href="#10_e_x">10. e x</a>:) And therefore also it is equall
  to that at <i>i</i> by the <a href="#10_e_x">10. e x</a>. Then the angles
  <i>auy</i>, and <i>asy</i>, are equall, by the <a href="#21_e_v">21. e
  v</a>. to the opposite inner angles at <i>e</i>, and <i>o</i>. Therefore
  it is equiangular unto it.</p>

  <p>Againe, it is proportionall to it in the shankes of the <!-- Page 143
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>[143]</span>equall angles.
  For the triangles <i>auy</i>, and <i>aei</i>, are alike, by the <a
  href="#12_e_vij">12 e vij</a>, because <i>uy</i> is parallell to the
  base. Therefore as <i>au</i> is <i>uy</i>; so is <i>ai</i> to <i>ei</i>:
  Then as <i>uy</i> is to <i>ya</i>; so is <i>ei</i> to <i>ia</i>. Againe
  by the <a href="#21_e_v">21 e v</a>, because <i>sy</i> is parallell to
  the base <i>io</i>, as <i>ay</i> is to <i>ys</i>: so is <i>ai</i>, to
  <i>io</i>: Therefore equiordinately, as <i>uy</i> is to <i>ys</i>: so is
  <i>ei</i> to <i>io</i>: Item as <i>sy</i> is to <i>ya</i>, so is
  <i>io</i> to <i>ia</i>: And as <i>ya</i> is to <i>as</i>: so is <i>ia</i>
  to <i>ao</i>. Therefore equiordinately, as <i>ys</i> is to <i>sa</i>: so
  is <i>io</i> to <i>oa</i>. Lastly as <i>sa</i> is unto <i>ay</i>; so is
  <i>oa</i> unto <i>ai</i>: And as <i>ay</i> is to <i>au</i>; so is
  <i>ai</i> unto <i>ae</i>. Therefore equiordinately, as <i>sa</i> is to
  <i>au</i>: so is <i>ao</i>, to <i>ae</i>. Wherefore the Diagonall
  <i>su</i> is proportionall in the shankes of equall angles to the
  parallelogramme <i>oe</i>.</p>

  <p>The demonstration shall be the same of the Diagonall <i>rl</i>. The
  like situation is manifest, by the <a href="#21_e_iiij">21 e iiij</a>.
  And from hence also is manifest, That the diagonall of a Quadrate, is a

  <p><i>Quadratum</i>, a Quadrate, or square, is a rectangled
  parallellogramme of equall sides: as here thou seest <i><span
  class="correction" title="text reads `aeao'">aeio</span></i>, to be.</p>

  <p>Plaines are with us, according to their diverse natures and qualities,
  measured with divers and sundry kindes of measures. Boord, Glasse, and
  Paving-stone are measured by the foote: Cloth, Wainscote, Painting,
  Paving, and such like, by the yard: Land, and Wood, by the Perch or
  Rodde.</p>

  <p>Of Measures and sundry sorts thereof commonly used and mentioned in
  histories we have in the former spoken at large: Yet for the farther
  confirmation of some thing then spoken, and here againe now upon this
  particular occasion repeated, it shall not be amisse to heare what our
  Statutes speake of these three sorts here mentioned.</p>

  <p>It is ordained, saith the Statute, That three Barley-cornes dry and
  round, doe make an <i>Ynch</i>: twelve ynches doe make a <i>Foote</i>:
  three foote doe make a <i>Yard</i>: Five yards and an halfe doe make a
  <i>Perch</i>: Fortie perches in length, and foure in breadth doe make an
  <i>Aker</i>. <i>33. Edwardi 1. De Terris mensurandis.</i> Item, <i>De
  compositione Ulnarum &amp; Perticarum</i>.</p>

  <p>Moreover observe, that all those measures there spoken <!-- Page 153
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>[153]</span>of were onely
  lengths: These here now last repeated, are such as the magnitudes by
  <span class="correction" title="text reads `the'">them</span> measured
  are, in Planimetry, I meane, they are Plaines: In Stereometry they are
  solids, as hereafter we shall make manifest. Therefore in that which
  followeth, An <i>ynch</i> is not onely a length three barley-cornes long:
  but a plaine three barley-cornes long, and three broad. A <i>Foote</i> is
  not onely a length of 12. ynches: But a plaine also of 12. ynches square,
  or containing 144. square ynches: A <i>yard</i> is not onely the length
  of three foote: But it is also a plaine 3. foote square every way. A
  <i>Perch</i> is not onely a length of 5½. yards: But it is a plot of
  ground 5½. yards square every way.</p>

  <p>A Quadrate therefore or square, seeing that it is equilater that is of
  equall sides: And equiangle by meanes of the equall right angles, of

  triangle are irrationall; Whereas the sides of a scalene are sometime
  rationall; and that after two manners, the one of <i>Pythagoras</i>, the
  other of <i>Plato</i>, as <i>Proclus</i> teacheth, at the 47. p j.
  <i>Pythagora's</i> way is thus, by an odde number.</p>

  <p>Or thus: If the square of an odde number given for the first <!-- Page

  have an unity taken from it, the halfe of the remainder shall be the
  other foote, and the same halfe increased by an unitie, shall be the
  base: <i>H</i>.</p>

  <p>As in the example: The sides are 3, 4, and 5. And 25. the square of 5.
  the base, is equall to 16. and 9. the squares of the shanks 4. and 3.</p>

  <p>Againe, the quadrate or square of 3. the first shanke is 9. and 9 - 1.
  is 8, whose halfe 4, is the other shanke. And 9 + 1, is 10. whose halfe
  5. is the base. <i>Plato's</i> way is thus by an even number.</p>

  </div>
  <p>As in this example where the sides are 6, 8. and 10. For 100. the
  square of 10. the base is equall to 36. and 64. the squares of the
  shankes 6. and 8.</p>

  <p>Againe, the quadrate or square of 3. the halfe of 6, the first shanke,
  is 9. and 9 - 1, is 8, for the second shanke. And out of this rate of
  rationall powers (as <i>Vitruvius</i>, in the 2. Chapter of his IX.
  booke) saith <i>Pythagoras</i> taught how to make a most exact and true
  squire, by joyning of three rulers together in the forme of a triangle,
  which are one unto another as 3, 4. and 5. are one to another.</p>

  <p>From hence Architecture learned an Arithmeticall proportion in the
  parts of ladders and stayres. For that rate or proportion, as in many
  businesses and measures is very commodious; so also in buildings, and
  making of ladders or staires, that they may have moderate rises of the
  steps, it is very speedy. For 9 + 1. is, 10, base. <!-- Page 157 --><span

  <p><a name="12_e_xij"></a> 12. <i>The power of the diagony is twise
  asmuch, as is the power of the side, and it is unto it also
  incommensurable</i>.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:26%;">
      <a href="images/178.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/178.png"
      alt="Figure for demonstration 12." title="Figure for demonstration 12." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>Or thus: The diagonall line is in power double to the side, and is
  incommensurable unto it, <i>H</i>.</p>

  <p>As here thou seest, let the first quadrate bee <i>aeio:</i> Of whose
  diagony <i>ai</i>, let there be made the quadrate <i>aiuy:</i> This, I
  say, shall be the double of that: seeing that the diagonies power is
  equall to the power of both the equall shankes. Therefore it is double to
  the power of one of them.</p>

  <p>This is the way of doubling of a square taught by <i>Plato</i>, as
  <i>Vitruvius</i> telleth us: Which notwithstanding may be also doubled,
  trebled, or according to any reason assigned increased, by the <a
  href="#25_e_iiij">25 e iiij</a>, as there was foretold.</p>

  <p>But that the Diagony is incommensurable unto the side it is the 116 p
  x. The reason is, because otherwise there might be given one quadrate
  number, double to another quadrate number: Which as <i>Theon</i> and
  <i>Campanus</i> teach us, is impossible to be found. But that reason
  which <i>Aristotle</i> bringeth is more cleare which is this; Because
  otherwise an even number should be odde. For if the Diagony be 4, and the
  side 3: The square of the Diagony 16, shall be double to the square of
  the side: And so the square of the side shall be 8. and the same square
  shall be 9, to wit, the square of 3. And so even shall be odde, which is
  most absurd.</p>

  <p>Hither may be added that at the 42 p x. That the segments of a right
  line diversly cut; the more unequall they are the greater is their
  power.</p>

  <p><a name="13_e_xij"></a> 13. <i>If the base of a right angled triangle
  be cut by a <!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page158"></a>[158]</span>perpendicular from the right angle in a
  doubled reason, the power of it shall be halfe as much more, as is the
  power of the greater shanke: But thrise so much as is the power of the
  lesser. If in a quadrupled reason, it shall be foure times and one fourth
  so much as is the greater: But five times so much as is the lesser, At
  the 13, 15, 16 p xiij</i>.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Or thus: If the base of a right angled triangle be cut in double
  proportion, by a perpendicular comming from the right angle, it is in
  power sesquialter to the greater foote; and treble to the lesser: But if
  the base be cut in quadruple proportion, it is sesquiarta to the greater
  side, and quintuple to the lesser.</p>

  <p>As in <i>aei</i>, let the base <i>ae</i>, be so cut that the segment
  <i>ao</i>, be double to the segment <i>oe</i>, to wit, as 2 is to 1. The
  whole <i>ae</i>, shall be unto <i>ao sesquialtera</i>, that is, as 2 is
  to 3. And therefore by the <a href="#10_e_viij">10 e viij</a>, and <a
  href="#25_e_iiij">25 e iiij</a>, the square of <i>ae</i>, shall be
  <i>sesquialterum</i> unto the square of <i>ai</i>.</p>

  </div>
  <p>And by the same argument it shall be treble unto the quadrate or
  square of <i>ei</i>.</p>

  <p>The other, of the fourefold or quadruple section, are manifest in the
  figure following, by the like argument.</p>

  <p><a name="14_e_xij"></a> 14 <i>If a right line be cut into how many
  parts so ever, the power of it is manifold unto the power of segment,
  denominated of the square of the number of the section</i>.</p>

  <p>Or thus: if a right <span class="correction" title="omitted in text"
  >line</span> be cut into how many parts soever it is in power the
  multiplex of the segment, the square of the number of the section, being
  denominated thereof: <i>H</i>. <!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  </div>
  <p>So if it be cut into two equall parts, the power of it shall be foure
  times so much, as is the power of the halfe, taking demonstration from 4,
  which is the square of 2, according to which the division was made: If it
  be cut into three equall parts, the power of it shall be nine fold the
  power of the third part. If into foure equall parts, it shall be 16 times
  so much as is the power of the quarter: As here thou seest in these
  examples.</p>

  <p>The third rate of a quadrate is hereafter with two rectangles, and two

  <p>This is the rate of a quadrate with a rectangle &amp; a quadrate, from

side doubled is 4 for the quotient; Which is found in 38, the
double plaine remaining 9 times, for the other side: But this
side is greater than the side of the next following quadrate:
Take therefore 1 out of it: And for nine take 8, and place
it in your quotient; Which 8 multiplyed by it selfe maketh
64, for the Lesser quadrate: And againe the same multiplyed
by 4 the divisour maketh 32; the summe of which two
products 384, subtracted from the remaine 384, leave nothing:
Therefore 784 is a Quadrate: And the side is 28.

  <p><i>And from hence the invention of a meane <span class="correction"
  title="text reads `proportionll'">proportionall</span>, betweene two
  numbers given, (if there be any such to be found) is manifest.</i> For if
  the product of two numbers given be a quadrate, the side of the quadrate
  shall be the meane proportionall, betweene the numbers given; as is
  apparent by the golden rule: As for example, Betweene 4. and 9. two
  numbers given, I desire to know what is the meane proportion. I multiply
  therefore 4 and 9. betweene themselves, and the product is 36: which is a
  quadrate number; as you see in the former; And the side is 6. Therefore I
  say, the meane proportionall betweene 4. and 9. is 6, that is, As 4. is
  to 6. so is 6. to 9.</p>

  <p>If the number given be not a quadrate, there shall no arithmeticall
  side, and to be expressed by a number be found: And this figurate number
  is but the shadow of a Geometricall figure, and doth not indeede expresse
  it fully, neither is such a quadrate rationall: Yet notwithstanding the
  numerall side of the greatest square in such like number may be found: As
  in 148. The greatest quadrate continued is 144 and the side is 12. And
  there doe remaine 4. Therefore of such kinde of number, which is not a
  quadrate, there is no true or exact side: Neither shall there ever be
  found any so neare unto the true one; but there may still be one found
  more neare the truth. Therefore the side is not to be expressed by a
  number.</p>

  <p>Of the invention of this there are two wayes: The one is by the
  <i>Addition of the gnomon</i>; The other is by the Reduction of the
  number assigned unto parts of some greater denomination. The first is
  thus:</p>

  <p><a name="17_e_xij"></a> 17 <i>If the side found be doubled, and to the
  double a unity be added, the whole shall be the gnomon of the next
  greater quadrate</i>.</p>

  <p>For the sides is one of the complements, and being doubled it is the
  side of both together. And an unity is the latter diagonall. So the side
  of 148 is 12.4/25.</p>

  <p>The reason of this dependeth on the same proposition, <!-- Page 164
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"></a>[164]</span>from whence
  also the whole side, is found. For seeing that the side of every quadrate
  lesser than the next follower differeth onely from the side of the
  quadrate next above greater than it but by an 1. the same unity, both
  twice multiplied by the side of the former quadrate, and also once by it
  selfe, doth make the <i>Gnomon</i> of the greater to be added to the
  quadrate. For it doth make the quadrate 169. Whereby is understood, that
  looke how much the numerator 4. is short of the denominatour 25. so much
  is the quadrate 148. short of the next greater quadrate. For <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `it'">if</span> thou doe adde 21.
  which is the difference whereby 4 is short of 25. thou shalt make the
  quadrate 169. whose side is 13. The second is by the reduction, as I
  said, of the number given unto parts assigned of some great denomination,
  as 100. or 1000. or some smaller than those, and those quadrates, that
  their true and certaine may be knowne: Now looke how much the smaller
  they are, so much nearer to the truth shall the side found be.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:18%;">
      <a href="images/185.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/185.png"
      alt="Figure for demonstration 17." title="Figure for demonstration 17." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>Let the same example be reduced unto hundreds squared parts, thus:
  1480000/10000. The side of 10000. by grant is 100. But the side of
  1480000. the numerator by the former is 1216. and beside there doe
  remaine 1344: thus, 1216/100. that is, 12.16/100, or 4/25 which was
  discovered by the former way. But in the side of the numerator there
  remained 1344. By which little this second way is more accurate and
  precise than the first. Yet notwithstanding those remaines are not
  regarded, because they cannot adde so much as 1/100 part unto the side,
  found: For neither in deed doe 1344/2426. make one hundred part.</p>

  <p>Moreover in lesser parts, the second way beside the other, doth shew
  the side to be somewhat greater than the side, by the first way found: as
  in 7. the side by the first way is 3/25. But by the second way the side
  of 7. reduced unto thousands quadrates, that is unto 7000000/1000000,
  that is, 2645/1000, and beside there doe remaine 3975. But 645/1000 are
  greater than 3/5. <!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page165"></a>[165]</span>For 3/5. reduced unto 1000. are but
  600/1000. Therefore the second way, in this example, doth exceed the
  first by 45/1000. those remaines 3975. being also neglected.</p>

  <p>Therefore this is the Analysis or manner of finding the side of a
  quadrate, by the first rate of a quadrate, equall to a double rectangle
  and quadrate.</p>

  <p>As for example, Let the sides of the triangle <i>aei</i>, be 6. 8. 10:

  the sides <i>ae</i> and <i>ei</i>, containing the right angle, the one by
  the other; and then taking the halfe of the product.</p>

  <p>This generall way of measuring a triangle is most easie and speedy,

  <i>Hero</i> is an infinite right line, which is stayed with a

  <i>Pappus</i> saith, in the beginning of his <span

  than the Plato's mesographus. The mechanicall handling of this
  mesographus, is described by <i>Eutocius</i> at the 1 Theoreme of the

  more plainely and easily thus layd downe by us.</p>

  <p>As let the two right-lines given be <i>ae</i>, and <i>ai</i>: And let
  them comprehend the rectangled parallelogramme <i>ao</i>: And let the
  said right lines given be continued infinitely, <i>ae</i> toward
  <i>u</i>; and <i>ai</i> toward <i>y</i>. Now let the Mesographus
  <i>uy</i>, touch <i>o</i>, the angle opposite to <i>a</i>: And let it cut
  the sayd continued lines equally distant from the Center. <!-- Page 173
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"></a>[173]</span></p>

  <p>(The center is found by the <a href="#8_e_iiij">8 e iiij</a>, to wit,
  by the meeting of the diagonies: For the equidistance from the center the
  Mesographus is to be moved up or downe, untill by the Compasses, it be
  found.)</p>

  <p>Now suppose the points of equidistancy thus found to be <i>u</i>, and
  <i>y</i>. I say, That the portions of the continued lines thus are the
  meane proportionalls sought: And as <i>ae</i> is to <i>iy</i>: so is
  <i>iy</i> to <i>eu</i>, so is <i>eu</i>, to <i>ai</i>.</p>

  <p>First let from <i>s</i>, the center, <i>sr</i> be perpendicular to the
  side <i>ae</i>: It shall therefore cut the said <i>ae</i>, into two
  parts, by the <a href="#5_e_xj">5 e xj</a>: And therefore againe, by the
  <a href="#7_e_xiij">7 e</a>, the oblong made of <i>au</i>, and <i>ue</i>,
  with the quadrate of <i>re</i>, is equall to the quadrate of <i>ru</i>:
  And taking to them in common <i>rs</i>, the oblong with two quadrates
  <i>er</i>, and <i>rs</i>, that is, by the <a href="#9_e_xij">9 e xij</a>,
  with the quadrate <i>se</i> is equall to the quadrates <i>ru</i> and
  <i>rs</i>, that is by the <a href="#9_e_xij">9 e xij</a>, to the quadrate
  <i>su</i>. The like is to be said of the oblong of <i>ay</i>, and
  <i>yi</i>, by drawing the perpendicular <i>sl</i>, as afore. For this
  oblong with the quadrates <i>li</i>, and <i>sl</i>, that is, by the <a
  href="#9_e_xij">9 e xij</a>, with the quadrate <i>is</i>, is equall to
  the quadrates <i>yl</i>, and <i>ls</i>, that is, by the <a
  href="#9_e_xij">9 e 12</a>, to <i>ys</i>. Therefore the oblongs equall to
  equalls, are equall betweene themselves: And taking from each side of
  equall rayes, by the <a href="#11_e_x">11 e x</a>, equall quadrates
  <i>se</i> and <i>si</i>, there shall remaine equalls. Wherefore by the <a

  <i>oi</i>, that is, by the <a href="#8_e_x">8 e x</a>, <i>ea</i>, to

  so is <i>ue</i>, to <i>ai</i>. Wherefore <i>eu</i>, <i>iy</i>, the

  </div>
  <p>This is the fabricke or manner of making a proportionall section. A
  threefold rate followeth: The first is of the greater segment.</p>

  <p>Let therefore the right line <i>ae</i>, be cut proportionally in
  <i>i</i>: And let the greater segment be <i>ia</i>: and let the line cut
  be continued unto <i>io</i>, so that <i>oa</i>, be the halfe of the line
  cut. I say, the quadrate of <i>io</i>, is in power five times so great,
  as <i>ys</i>, the power of the quadrate of <i>ao</i>. Let therefore of
  <i>ao</i>, be made the quadrate <i>iosr</i>: We doe see the quadrate
  <i>ua</i>, to be once contained in the quadrate <i>si</i>. Let us now
  <!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  comprehended in <i>lmn</i>, the gnomon remaining: Let therefore the
  quadrate <i>aeiu</i>, be made of the line given: And let <i>ri</i>, be
  continued unto <i>f</i>. Here the quadrate <i>ae</i>, is (<a
  href="#14_e_xij">14. e xij</a>.) foure times so much as is that
  <i>au</i>, made of the halfe: and it is also equall to the gnomon
  <i>lmn</i>: For the part <i>iu</i>, is equall to <i>ry</i>; first by the
  grant, seeing that <i>ai</i>, is the greater segment, from whence
  <i>ry</i>, is made the quadrate, because the other Diagonall is also a
  quadrate: Secondarily the complements <i>sy</i>, and <i>yi</i>, by the <a
  href="#19_e_x">19. e x</a>, are equall: And to them is equall <i>af</i>.
  For by the <a href="#23_e_x">23. e x</a>. and by the grant, it is the
  double of the complement <i>yi</i>. Therefore it is equall to them both.
  Wherefore the gnomon <i>lmn</i>, is equall to the quadruple quadrate of
  the said little quadrate: And the greater segment continued to the halfe
  of the right line given is of power five fold to the power of
  <i>ao</i>.</p>

  <p>The converse is apparent in the same example: For seeing that
  <i>io</i>, is of power five times so much as is <i>ao</i>; the gnomon
  <i>lmn</i>, shall be foure times so much as is <i>ua</i>: Whose quadruple
  also, by the <a href="#14_e_xij">14. e xij</a>, is <i>av</i>. Therefore
  it is equall to the gnomon. Now <i>aj</i>, is equall to <i>ae</i>:
  Therefore it is the double also of <i>ao</i>, that is of <i>ay</i>: And
  therefore by the <a href="#24_e_x">24. e x</a>. it is the double of
  <i>at</i>: And therefore it is equall to the complements <i>iy</i>, and
  <i>ys</i>: Therefore the other diagonall <i>yr</i>, is equall to the

  <i>o</i>, the halfe of the greater <i>ai</i>. I say, that the power of
  <i>oe</i>, shall be five times as much as is the power of <i>io</i>. Let
  a quadrate <!-- Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  the figure be made up (as you see:) And let the quadrate of the halfe be
  noted with <i>su</i>: And the gnomon <i>rlm</i>. Here the first quadrate
  <i>oy</i>, is five times as great, as the second <i>su</i>. For it doe
  containe it once: And the gnomon <i>rlm</i>, remaining containeth it
  foure times. For it is equall to the Oblong <i>in</i>; because <i>os</i>,
  the complement is equall to <i>sy</i>, by the <a href="#19_e_x">19 e

  <i>av</i>, is equall to <i>os</i>, by the construction, and <a
  href="#23_e_x">23. e x</a>: And adding to both the common oblong

<h2>The fifteenth Booke of <i>Geometry</i>,
Of the Lines in a Circle.</h2>

  <p>As yet we have had the Geometry of rectilineals: The Geometry of
  Curvilineals, of which the Circle is the chiefe, doth follow.</p>

  <p><a name="1_e_xv"></a> 1. <i>A Circle is a round plaine. è 15 d

  </div>
  <p>As here thou seest. A Rectilineall plaine was at the <a
  href="#3_e_vj">3 e vj</a>, defined to be a plaine comprehended of right
  lines. And so also might a circle have beene defined to be a plaine
  comprehended of a periphery or bought-line, but this is better.</p>

  <p>The meanes to describe a Circle, is the same, which was to make a
  Periphery: But with some difference: For there was considered no more but
  the motion, the point in the end of the ray describing the periphery:
  Here is considered the motion of the whole ray, making the whole plot
  conteined within the periphery.</p>

  <p>A Circle of all plaines is the most ordinate figure, as was before
  taught at the <a href="#10_e_iiij">10 e iiij</a>.</p>

  <p>For Circles are like plaines. And their homologall sides are their

  therefore by the <a href="#1_e_vj">1 e vj</a>, they are one to another,
  as the quadrates of their diameters are one to another, which indeed is
  the double reason of their homologall sides. As here the Circle
  <i>aei</i>, is unto the Circle <i>ouy</i> as 25, is unto 16, which are

  that the <span class="correction" title="text reads `once'">one</span>
  inscript thus halfing the other, is the diameter of the Circle: And that
  the middest of it is the center thereof: As in the circle, let the
  Inscript <i>is</i>, cut the inscript <i>ae</i>, and that perpendicularly
  dividing into two equall parts in <i>o</i>. I say that <i>iu</i>, thus
  dividing <i>ae</i>, is the Diameter of the Circle: And <i>y</i>, the
  middest of the said <i>iu</i>, is the Center of the same.</p>

  <p>The cause is the same, which was of the <a href="#5_e_xj">5 e xj</a>.
  Because the inscript cut into halfes <span class="correction" title="text reads `if'"
  >is</span> for the side of the inscribed rectangle, and it doth subtend
  the periphery cut also into two parts; By the which both the Inscript and
  Periphery also were in like manner cut into two equall parts: Therefore
  the right line thus halfing in the diameter of the rectangle: But that
  the middle of the circle is the center, is manifest out of the <a
  href="#7_e_v">7 e v</a>, and <a href="#29_e_iiij">29 e iiij</a>.</p>

  <p><i>Euclide</i>, thought better of <i>Impossibile</i>, than he did of
  the cause: And thus he forceth it. For if <i>y</i> be not the Center, but
  <i>s</i>, the part must be equall to the whole: For the Triangle
  <i>aos</i>, shall be equilater to the triangle <i>eos</i>. For <i>ao</i>,
  <i>oe</i>, are equall by the grant: Item <i>sa</i>, and <i>se</i>, are
  the rayes of the circle: And <i>so</i>, is common to both the triangles.
  Therefore by the <a href="#1_e_vij">1 e vij</a>, the angles <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `no'">on</span> each side at
  <i>o</i> are equall; And by the <a href="#13_e_v">13 e v</a>, they are
  both right angles. Therefore <i>soe</i> is a right angle; It is therefore
  equall by the grant, to the right angle <i>yoe</i>, that is, the part is
  equall to the whole, which is impossible. Wherefore <span

  <p>This is a consectary drawne out of the <a href="#28_e_iiij">28 e

  in the first figure. For the Rectangle of the segments, of the one is

  it: Other inscripts are judged to be equall, greater, or lesser one than
  another, by the diameter, or by the diameters center.</p>

  <p><i>Euclide</i> doth demonstrate this proposition thus: Let first
  <i>ae</i> and <i>io</i> be equall; I say they are equidistant from the
  center. For let <i>uy</i>, and <span class="correction" title="text reads `uy'"
  ><i>us</i></span>, be perpendiculars: They shall cut the assigned
  <i>ae</i>, &amp; <i>io</i>, into halfes, by the <a href="#5_e_xj">5 e

  halfes of equals. Now let the raies of the circle be <i>ua</i>, <span

  quadrates by the <a href="#9_e_xij">9 e xij</a>, are equall to the paire
  of quadrates of the shankes, which paires are therefore equall betweene
  themselves. Take from equalls the quadrates <i>ya</i>, and <i>si</i>,
  there shall remaine <i>yu</i>, and <i>us</i>, equalls: and therefore the
  sides are equall, by the <a href="#4_e_xij">4 e 12</a>.</p>

  <p>The converse likewise is manifest: For the perpendiculars given do
  halfe them: And the halfes as before are equall.</p>

  <p>Let there be in a circle; many inscripts, of which one, to wit,
  <i>ae</i>, let it be the diameter: I say, that it is of them all the
  greatest or longest. But let <i>io</i>, be nearer to the diameter, (or as
  in the former Elements was said) nearer to the center, than <i>uy</i>. I
  say that <i>io</i>, is longer than <i>uy</i>. Moreover, let <i>uy</i>, be
  the farthest off from the same diameter or center; I say the same
  <i>uy</i>, is the shortest of them all. Now to this shortest <i>uy</i>,
  let <i>io</i>, be nearer than <i>ae</i>; I say therefore that <i>io</i>,
  also is lesser than <i>ae</i>. Let at length <i>io</i>, be not the
  diameter: I say that beyond the diameter <i>ae</i>, there may onely a
  line be inscribed equall unto it, such as is <i>sr</i>. And those equal
  betweene themselves on each side of the diametry may only be given, not
  three, nor more. And after the same manner also, onely one beyond the
  diameter, may possibly be equall to <i>uy</i>, to wit, that which is as
  farre off from the diameter as it is; and so in others.</p>

  <p>But Euclides conclusion is by triangles of two sides greater than the
  other; and of the greater angle.</p>

  <p>The first part is plaine thus: Because the diameter <i>ae</i>, is
  equall to <i>il</i>, and <i>lo</i>, <i>viz</i>. to the raies; And to
  those which are greater than <i>io</i>, the base by the <a
  href="#9_e_vj">9. e vj</a> &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The second part of the nearer, is manifest by the <a href="#5_e_vij">5
  e vij</a>. because of the triangle <i>ilo</i>, equicrurall to the
  triangle <i>uly</i>, is greater in angle: And therefore it is also
  greater in base.</p>

  <p>The third and fourth are consectaries of the first.</p>

  <p>The fifth part is manifest by the second: For if beside <i>io</i>, and
  <i>sr</i>, there be supposed a third equall, the same also shall be
  unequall, because it shall be both nearer and farther off from the
  diameter. <!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>This was to have beene made a <i>postulatum</i> out of the definition
  of a perpendicle: Because if this should leane never so little, it should
  cut the periphery, and should not be perpendicular: Notwithstanding
  <i>Euclide</i> doth force it thus: Otherwise let the right line
  <i>ae</i>, be perpendicular to the diameter <i>ai</i>. And a right line
  from <i>o</i>, with the center <i>i</i>, let it fall within the circle at
  <i>o</i>, and let <i>oi</i>, joyned together. Here in the triangle

  <p>The demonstration of the converse is like unto the former. For if the

  <i>iou</i>, let <i>oe</i>, from the center <i>o</i>, be drawne

  <p>The first part is manifest, because the part should be equall to the

  are equall to the common raie <i>ao</i>: And therefore <i>ae</i> and
  <i>ai</i>, that is, the part and the whole, are equall one to
  another.</p>

  <p>The second part is demonstrated as the first: For otherwise the part
  must be equall to the whole, as here <i>ae</i> and <i>ai</i>, the raies
  of the lesser periphery; And <i>ae</i>, and <i>ao</i>, the raies of the

  <p>The third part is apparent out of the first: Otherwise those which cut

  three right lines being drawne from the center unto three points of <!--

  <p>The fourth part is demonstrated after the same manner: Because
  otherwise the Part must be greater then the whole. For let the right line
  <i>aeio</i>, be drawne by the centers <i>a</i> and <i>e</i>: And let the
  particular raies be <i>eu</i>, and <i>au</i>. Here two sides <i>ue</i>,
  and <i>ea</i>, of the triangle <i>uea</i>, by the <a href="#9_e_vj">9 e

  Take away <i>ae</i>, the remainder <i>ue</i>, shall be greater than

  <p>The same will fall out, if the touch be without, as here: For, by the

  <i>ie</i>. But <i>eo</i> and <i>iu</i>, are equall to <i>ea</i>, and
  <i>ia</i>. Wherefore <i>eo</i>, and <i>iu</i>, are greater than

  <i>ou</i> cutting it into two triangles on each side equicrurall; And, by

  <p>The second example is thus of the angle in the center <i>aei</i>: And

  <p>There are seven parts of this Element: The first is that <i>The angle
  in a semicircle is a right angle</i>: as in <i>aei</i>: For if the ray
  <i>oe</i>, be drawne, the angle <i>aei</i>, shall be divided into two
  angles <i>aeo</i>, and <i>oei</i>, equall to the angles <i>eao</i>, and
  <i>eio</i>, by the <a href="#17_e_vj">17 e vj</a>. Therefore seeing that
  one angle is equall to the other two, it is a right angle, by the <a
  href="#6_e_viij">6 e viij</a>. <i>Aristotle</i> saith that the angle in a
  semicircle is a right angle, because it is the halfe of two right angles,
  which is all one in effect.</p>

  <p>The second part, <i>That the angle of a semicircle is lesser than a
  right angle</i>; is manifest out of that, because it is the part of a
  right angle. For the angle of <span class="correction" title="text reads `these micircle'"
  >the semicircle</span> <i>aie</i>, is part of the rectilineall right
  angle <i>aiu</i>.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:21%;">

      alt="Figure for demonstration 21, fourth to seventh." title="Figure for demonstration 21, fourth to seventh." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The third part, That it is greater than any acute angle; is manifest
  out of the <a href="#23_e_xv">23. e xv</a>. For otherwise a tangent were
  not on the same part one onely and no more.</p>

  <p>The fourth part is thus made manifest: The angle at <i>i</i>, in the
  greater section <i>aei</i>, is lesser than a right angle; because it is
  in the same triangle <i>aei</i>, which at <i>a</i>, is a right angle. And
  if neither of the shankes be by the center, not withstanding an angle may
  be made equall to the assigned in the same section.</p>

  <p>The fifth is thus: The angle of the greater section <i>eai</i>, is
  greater than a right angle: because it containeth a right-angle. <!--
  Page 210 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210"></a>[210]</span></p>

  <p>The sixth is thus, the angle <i>aoe</i>, in a lesser section, is
  greater than a right angle, by the <a href="#14_e_xvj">14 e xvj</a>.
  Because that which is in the opposite section, is lesser than a right
  angle.</p>

  <p>The seventh is thus. The angle <i>eao</i>, is lesser than a
  right-angle: Because it is part of a right angle, to wit of the outter
  angle, if <i>ia</i>, be drawne out at length.</p>

  <p>And thus much of the angles of a circle, of all which the most
  effectuall and of greater power and use is the angle in a semicircle, and
  therefore it is not without cause so often mentioned of <i>Aristotle</i>.
  This Geometry therefore of <i>Aristotle</i>, let us somewhat more fully
  open and declare. For from hence doe arise many things.</p>

<h2>Of <i>Geometry</i> the seventeenth Booke,
Of the Adscription of a Circle
and Triangle.</h2>

  <p>Hitherto we have spoken of the Geometry of Rectilineall plaines, and
  of a circle: Now followeth the Adscription of both: This was generally
  defined in the first book <a href="#12_e_j">12 e</a>. Now the periphery
  of a circle is the bound therof. Therefore a rectilineall is inscribed
  into a circle, when the periphery doth touch the angles of it 3 d iiij.
  It is circumscribed when it is touched of every side by the periphery; 4
  d iij.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:22%;">
      <a href="images/237a.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/237a.png"
      alt="Figure for demonstration 1." title="Figure for demonstration 1." /></a>
  </div>
  <p><a name="1_e_xvij"></a> 1. <i>If rectilineall ascribed unto a circle
  be an equilater, it is equiangle</i>.</p>

  <p>Of the inscript it is manifest; And that of a Triangle by it selfe:
  Because if it be equilater, it is equiangle, by the <a href="#19_e_vj">19
  e vj</a>. But in a Triangulate the matter is to be prooved by
  demonstration. As here, if the inscripts <i>ou</i>, and <i>sy</i>, be
  equall, then doe they subtend equall peripheries, by the 32 <!-- Page 216
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page216"></a>[216]</span>e xv. Then if
  you doe omit the periphery in the middest betweene them both, as here
  <i>uy</i>, and shalt adde <i>oies</i> the remainder to each of them, the
  whole <i>oiesy</i>, subtended to the angle at <i>u</i>: And <i>uoies</i>,
  subtended to the angle at <i>y</i>, shall be equall. Therefore the angles
  in the periphery, insisting upon equall peripheries are equall.</p>

  <p>Of the circumscript it is likewise true, if the circumscript be
  understood to be a circle. For the perpendiculars from the center
  <i>a</i>, unto the sides of the circumscript, by the <a href="#9_e_xij">9
  e xij</a>, shal make triangles on each side equilaters, &amp; equiangls,
  by drawing the semidiameters unto the corners, as in the same
  ex&#x101;ple.</p>

  <p><a name="2_e_xvij"></a> 2. <i>It is equall to a triangle of equall
  base to the perimeter, but of heighth to the perpendicular from the
  center to the side</i>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217"></a>[217]</span></p>

  <p>As here is manifest, by the <a href="#8_e_vij">8 e vij</a>. For there
  are in one triangle, three triangles of equall heighth.</p>

  <p><br style="clear : both" /></p>

  </div>
  <p>The same will fall out in a Triangulate, as here in a quadrate: For
  here shal be made foure triangles of equall height.</p>

  <p>Lastly every equilater rectilineall ascribed to a circle, shall be
  equall to a triangle, of base equall to the perimeter of the adscript.
  Because the perimeter conteineth the bases of the triangles, into the
  which the rectilineall is resolved.</p>

  <p><a name="3_e_xvij"></a> 3. <i>Like rectilinealls inscribed into
  circles, are one to another as the quadrates of their diameters, 1 p.

  </div>
  <p>Because by the <a href="#1_e_vj">1 e vj</a>, like plains have a
  doubled reasó of their homologall sides. But in rectilineals inscribed
  the diameters are the homologall sides, or they are proportionall to
  their homologall sides. As let the like rectangled triangles be
  <i>aei</i>, and <i>ouy</i>; Here because <i>ae</i> and <i>ou</i>, are the
  diameters, the matter appeareth to be plaine at the first sight. But in
  the Obliquangled triangles, <i>sei</i>, and <i>ruy</i>, alike also, the
  diameters are proportionall to their homologall sides, to wit, <i>ei</i>
  and <i>uy</i>. For by the grant, as <i>se</i> is to <i>ru</i>: so is
  <i>ei</i> to <i>uy</i>, And therefore, by the former, <span
  class="correction" title="text is in italics, wrongly">as</span> the
  diameter <i>ea</i> and <i>uo</i>.</p>

  <p>In like Triangulates, seeing by the <a href="#4_e_x">4 e x</a>, they
  may be resolved into like triangles, the same will fall out.</p>

  <p>As in the Triangle <i>aei</i>, let the right lines <i>ao</i>, and
  <i>eu</i>, halfe the angles <i>a</i> and <i>e</i>: And from <i>y</i>,
  their meeting, let the perpendiculars unto the sides be <i>yo</i>,
  <i>yu</i>, <i>ys</i>; I say that the center <i>y</i>, with the ray
  <i>yo</i>, or <i>ya</i>, or <i>ys</i>, is the circle inscribed, by the <a
  href="#17_e_xv">17 e xv</a>. Because the halfing lines with the
  perpendiculars shall make equilater triangles, by the <a
  href="#2_e_vij">2 e vij</a>. And therefore the three perpendiculars,
  which are the bases of the equilaters, shall be equall. <!-- Page 219

  <p>The same argument shall serve in a Triangulate.</p>

  <p>As in former figures. The demonstration is the same with the former.
  For the three rayes, by the <a href="#2_e_vij">2 e vij</a>, are equall:
  And the meeting of them, by the <a href="#17_e_x">17 e x</a>, is the

  <p>Let the Triangle <i>aei</i> be given: And the circle, <i>o</i>, into

  <i>aie</i>. But the outter angle <i>eoi</i>, is equall to the same two,
  by the <a href="#15_e_vj">15 e vj</a>. Therefore the angles <i>ioe</i>

  <p>But the base <i>ei</i>, is the side of the equilater quinquangle. For
  if two right lines halfing both the angles of a triangle which is the
  double of the remainder, be knit together with a right line, both one to
  another, and with the angles, shall inscribe unto a circle an equilater
  triangle, whose one side shall be the base it selfe: As here seeing the
  angles <i>eoa</i>, <i>eoi</i>, <i>uio</i>, <i>uia</i>, <i>iao</i>, are
  equal in the periphery, the peripheries, by the <a href="#7_e_xvj">7 e,

  <i>io</i>, <i>ou</i>, <i>ua</i>, are also equall. Now of those five, one

  the grant, and by the <a href="#2_e_vij">2 e, vij</a>. Therefore the
  angles <i>aie</i>, and <i>aes</i>, are equall. Then <i>aei</i>, and
  <i>ase</i>, are equall: Because the <!-- Page 225 --><span

  the <a href="#1_e_xiiij">1 e, xiiij</a>. <i>ia</i>, is cut proportionally

  <a href="#17_e_vj">17. e, vj</a>. For the angles at the base, <i>ise</i>,

  a halfe periphery. For the halfe periphery <i>als</i>, is equall to the
  halfe periphery <i>ars</i>: and also <i>al</i>, is equall to <i>ar</i>.
  Therefore the remnant <i>ls</i>, is equall to the remnant <i>rs</i>: And
  the whole <i>rl</i>, is the double of the same <i>rs</i>: And therefore

  quadrate and Circle measured. For the reason of 196, unto a 154; is the
  reason of 14 unto 11, as will appeare by the reduction of the bounds.</p>

  <p>This is the second manner of squaring of a circle taught by

  unto the quadrate <i>oi</i>. And by compounding <i>ao</i> with <i>oe</i>;
  As <i>ae</i> is to <i>oe</i>; so are the quadrates <i>ao</i>; and
  <i>oi</i>, that is, by the <a href="#9_e_xij">9 e xij</a>, the quadrate
  <i>ai</i>, unto the quadrate <i>oi</i>, But <i>ae</i> is the triple of
  <i>oe</i>. Therefore the quadrate <i>ai</i>, is the triple of the

  treble power to the ray: And therefore also all the sides are equall: And
  therefore againe the triangles themselves are equall.</p>

  <p>As in the example a prisma pentaedrum is cut into three equall

  <p>The heighth of a pyramis shall be found, if you shall take the square
  of the ray of the base out of the quadrate of the side: for the side of
  the remainder, by the <a href="#9_e_xij">9 e xij</a>, shall be the

  <p>Here the content of the triangle by the <a href="#18_e_xij">18 e

  altitude is 9.15/19: Because by the <a href="#12_e_xviij"><span
  class="correction" title="text reads `6 e xviij'">12 e xviij</span></a>,
  the side is of treble power to the ray. But if from 144, the quadrate of

  the <a href="#9_e_xij">9 e xij</a>, shall be the square of the heighth.
  And the side of the quadrate shall be 9.15/19. Now the third part of
  9.15/19 is 3.5/19. And the plaine of 62.44/125 and 3.5/19, shall be

  <p>So in the example following, Let 36, the quadrate of 6 the ray, be

  third part is 5.37/102; the plaine of which by the base 72.1/4 shall be
  387.11/24 for the solidity of the pyramis given.</p>

  <p>If the pyramis be unperfit, first measure the whole, and then that
  part which is wanting: Lastly from the whole <!-- Page 259 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page259"></a>[259]</span>subtract that which was
  wanting, and the remaine shall be the solidity of the unperfect pyramis
  given: As here, let <i>ao</i>, the side of the whole be 16.5/12,
  <i>eo</i> the side of the particular be 8.1/16. Therefore the
  perpendicular of the whole <i>ou</i>, shall be <span class="correction"

  >15.5/32</span>: Whose third part is 5.5/96: Of which, and the base
  93.3/11 the plaine shall be 471.134/1056 for the whole pyramis. But in
  the lesser pyramis, 9 the square of the ray 3, taken out of 65.1/256 the
  quadrate of the side 8.1/16 the remaine shall be 56.1/256; whose side is
  almost 7-1/2 for the heighth. The third part of which is 2-1/2. The base
  likewise is almost 22. The plaine of which two is 55, for the solidity of
  the lesser pyramis: And 471 - 55 is 416, for the imperfect pyramis.</p>

  <p>After this manner you may measure an imperfect Prisma.</p>

  <p><i>Euclide</i> doth demonstrate it thus: Let the Pentaedra's

  <p>This is the generall invention of a Cube, both Geometricall and
  Arithmeticall.</p>

  <p><a name="10_e_xxiiij"></a> 10 <i>If a right line be cut into two
  segments, the Cube of the whole shall be equall to the Cubes of the
  segments, and a double solid thrice comprehended of the quadrate of his
  owne segment and the other segment</i>.</p>

  <p>As for example, the side 12, let it be cut into two segments 10 and 2.
  The cube of 12. the whole, which is 1728, shall be equall to two cubes
  1000, and 8 made of the segments 10. and 2. And a double solid; of which
  the first 600. is thrise comprehended of 100. the quadrate of his segment
  10. and of 2. the other segment: The second 120. is thrice comprehended
  of 4, the quadrate of his owne segment, and of 10. the other segment. Now
  1000 + 600 + 120. + 8, is equall to 1728: And therefore a right.
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>But the genesis of the whole cube will make all this whole matter more
  apparant, to wit, how the extreme and meane solids are made. Let
  therefore a cube be made of three equall sides, 12, 12, and 12: And first
  of all let the second side be multiplied by the first, after this manner:
  And not adding the severall figures of the same degree, as was taught in
  multiplication, but multiply againe every one of them by the other side;

  <p><a name="11_e_xxiiij"></a> 11. <i>The side of the first severall cube
  is the other side of the second solide: And the quadrate of the same side
  is the other side of the first solide, whose other side is the side of
  the second cube; and the quadrate of the same other side is the other
  side of the second solid</i>.</p>

  <p>In that equation therefore of foure solids with one solid, thou shalt
  consider a peculiar making and composition: First that the last cube be
  made of the last segment 2: Then that the second solid of 4, the quadrate
  of his owne segment, and of 10, the other segment be thrise comprehended:
  Lastly that the first solid of 100, the square of his owne segment 10 and
  the other segment 2, be also thrice comprehended: Lastly, that the Cube
  1000, be made of the greater segment 10. Out of this making &amp;c.</p>

  <p>And thus much of the Cube: Of other sorts of parallelepipedes, as of
  the Oblong, the Rhombe, the Rhomboides, and of the Trapezium, and many
  flatted pentaedra's there is no <!-- Page 268 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page268"></a>[268]</span>peculiar stereometry. The measuring of a
  Prisma hath in the former beene generally declared, and is now onely
  farther be made more plaine by speciall examples; as here:</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:44%;">
      <a href="images/289a.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/289a.png"
      alt="Figure for Demonstration 11." title="Figure for Demonstration 11." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The plaine of the perimeter of the base 20, and the altitude 5 is 100.
  This added to 25 and 25, both the bases that is to 50, maketh 150, for
  the whole surface. Now the plaine of 25 the base, and the heighth 5 is
  125, for the whole solidity.</p>

  <p>So in the Oblong, the plaine of the base's perimeter 20, and the
  heighth 11, is 220, which added to the bases 24 and 24, that is 48,
  maketh 268, for the whole surface. But the plaine of the base 24, and the
  height 11, is 264, for the solidity.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:35%;">
      <a href="images/289b.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/289b.png"
      alt="Figure for Demonstration 11." title="Figure for Demonstration 11." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The same also Geodesie or manner of measuring is used in the measuring
  of rectangled walls or gates and doores, which have either any window, or
  any hollow <!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page269"></a>[269]</span>or voyde space cut out of them, if those
  voyde places be taken out of them; as here thou seest in the next
  following example. The thickenesse is 3 foote; the breadth 12, the
  heighth 11. Therefore the whole solidity is 396. Now the Gate way is of
  thickenesse 3 foote, of breadth 4: of heighth 6. And therefore the whole
  solidity of the Gate is 72 foote. But 396 - 72 are 314. Therefore the
  solidity of the rest of the wall remaining is 324.</p>

  <p>In the second example, the length is 10. The breadth 8, the heighth 7.
  Therefore the whole body if it were found, were 560 foote. But there is
  an hollow in it, whose length is 6, breadth 5, heighth 7. Therefore the
  cavity or hollow place is 168. Now 560 - 168 is 392, for the solidity of
  the rest of the sound body.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Thus are such kinde of walls whether of mudde, bricke, or stone, of
  most large houses to bee measured. The same manner of Geodesy is also to
  be used in the measuring of a Rhombe, Rhomboides, Trapezium or mensall,
  and any kinde of multangled body. The base is first to be measured, as in
  the former: Then out of that and the heighth the solidity shall be
  manifested: As in the Rhombe the base is 24, the heighth 4. Therefore the
  solidity is 96.</p>

  <p>In the Rhomboides, the base is 64.35/129: The heigh <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `11', result requires `16'"
  >16</span>. Therefore the solidity is 1028.44/129.</p>

  <p>The same is the geodesy of a trapezium, as in these examples: The
  surface of the first is 198: The solidity 192.1/2.</p>

  <p>The surface of the second is 158.3/49: The solidity is 91.29/49. <!--

  </div>
  <p>The same shall be also the geodesy of a many flatted Prisma: As here
  thou seest in an Octoedrum of a sexangular base: The surface shall bee
  762.6/11: The solidity 1492.4/11.</p>

  </div>
  <p>And from hence also may the capacity or content of vessels or
  measures, made after any manner of plaine solid bee esteemed and judged
  of as here thou seest. For here the plaine of the sexangular base is
  41.1/7; (For the ray, by the <a href="#9_e_xviij">9 e xviij</a>, is the
  side:) and the heighth 5, shall be 205.5/7. Therefore if a cubicall foote
  doe conteine 4 quarters, as we commonly call them, then shall the vessell
  conteine 822.6/7 quartes, that is almost 823 quartes.</p>

  perpendiculars, they are also, by the <a href="#6_e_xxj">6 e xxj</a>.

  <p>And from hence also shall be the geodesy of the Icosaedrum. For the
  finding out of the heighth of the pyramis, there is the semidiagony of
  the side of the decangle and the halfe ray of the circle: But the side of
  the decangle is a right line subtending the halfe periphery of the side
  of the quinquangle, or else the greater segment of the ray <!-- Page 278
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page278"></a>[278]</span>proportionally
  cut. For so it may be taken Geometrically, and reckoned for his measure.
  Therefore if the quadrate of the side of the decangle, be taken out of
  the quadrate of the side of the quinquangle, there shall by the <a
  href="#15_e_xviij">15 e xviij</a>, remaine the quadrate of the sexangle,
  that is of the ray. The side of the decangle (because the side of the
  quinquangle here is 6) shall be 3.3/35 to wit a right line subtending the
  halfe periphery. Now the halfe ray shall thus be had. The quadrates of
  the quinquangle and decangle are 36, and 9.639/1225. And this being
  subducted fro that, the remaine 26.386/1225 by the <a
  href="#15_e_xviij">15 e xviij</a>, shall be the quadrate or square of the
  sexangle: And the side of it, 5, and almost 5/7 shall be the ray: The
  halfe ray therefore shall be 2.6/7. To the side of the decangle 3.3/35
  adde 2.6/7: the whole shal be 5.33/35 for the semi-diagony of the
  Icosaedrum. The ray of the circle circumscribed about the triangle, is by
  the <a href="#12_e_xviij">12 e xviij</a>, the same which was before 3.3/7
  to wit of the quadrate 12. Therefore if the quadrate of the circular ray,
  be taken out of the quadrate of the halfe diagony, there shall remaine
  the quadrate of the heighth and perpendicular: the quadrate of the
  halfe-diagony is 35.389/1225: the quadrate of the circular ray is 12.
  This taken out of that beneath 23.639/1225: whose side is almost 5, for
  the perpendicular and heighth proposed: From whence now the Pyramis is
  esteemed. The case of a triangular pyramis is 15.18/31. The Plaine of
  this base and the third part of the heighth is 25.30/31 for the solidity
  of one Pyramis. This multiplyed by 20 maketh 519.11/31 for the summe or

  <p>Let there be two plaines for a cube for all, that one quinquangle for
  twelve may be described, and they abutting one upon another, <i>aeio</i>,
  and <i>euyi</i>, having their sides halfed by the bisecantes, <i>sr</i>,
  <i>lm</i>, <i>rn</i>, <i>jv</i>: And the three bisegments or portions of
  the bisegments <i>lm</i>, and <i>rn</i>, neither concurring or meeting,
  nor parallell one to another; two of the said <i>lm</i>, to wit,
  <i>fl</i>, and <i>fm</i>: The third next unto the remainder, that is
  <i>lr</i>. And let each bisegment be cut proportionally in the points
  <i>d</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>g</i>; so that the lesser segments doe bound the
  bisecant, to wit, <i>dl</i>, <i>cm</i>, and <i>gr</i>. Lastly let there
  be three perpendiculars from the points <i>db</i>, <i>cg</i>, to the said
  <i>d</i>, <i>cp</i>, <i>gz</i>: And the two first knit one to another, by
  <i>bp</i>: And againe with the angles of the cube, by <i>be</i>, and
  <i>pi</i>: The third knit with the same angles, by <i>ze</i>, and
  <i>zi</i>: And let all the plaines be made up. I say first, that the five
  sides <i>bp</i>, <i>pi</i>, <i>iz</i>, <i>ze</i>, and <i>eb</i> are
  equall; Because, every one of them severally are the doubles of the same
  greater segment. For in drawing the right lines <i>de</i> and <i>eg</i>,
  <i>ig</i>, it shall be plaine of two of them; And after the same manner
  of the rest. First therefore <i>cd</i>, and <i>bp</i>, are equall by the
  <a href="#6_e_xxj">6 e xxj</a>, and by the <a href="#27_e_v">27 e v</a>.
  Therefore <i>bp</i>, is the double of the greater segment. Then the whole
  <i>fl</i>, cut proportionally, and the lesser segment <i>dl</i>, they are
  by the <a href="#7_e_xiiij">7 e xiiij</a>, of treble power to the greater
  <i>fd</i>, that is, by the fabricke <i>db</i>. Therefore <i>le</i> wich
  is equall to <i>lf</i>, the line cut, and <i>ld</i>, are of treble power
  to the same <i>db</i>: But by the <a href="#9_e_xij">9 e xij</a>,
  <i>de</i> is of as much power as <i>le</i>, and <i>ld</i> too. <!-- Page
  281 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page281"></a>[281]</span>Therefore
  <i>de</i> is of treble power to <i>db</i>. Therefore both <i>ed</i>, and
  <i>db</i>, are of quadruple power to <i>db</i>. But <i>be</i>, by the <a
  href="#9_e_xij">9 e xij</a>, is of as much power as <i>ed</i>, and
  <i>db</i>. And therefore <i>be</i>, is of quadruple value to <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `eb'"><i>db</i></span>: And by the
  <a href="#14_e_xij">14 e xij</a>, it is the double of the said <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `eb'"><i>db</i></span>. Therefore
  the two sides <i>eb</i>, and <i>bp</i>, are equall: And by the same
  argument <i>pi</i>, <i>iz</i>, and <i>ze</i>, are equall. Therefore the
  quinquangle is equilater.</p>

  <p>I say also that it is a Plaine quinquangle: For it may be said to be
  an oblique quinquangle; and to be seated in two plaines. Let therefore
  <i>fh</i> be parallell to <i>db</i>, and <i>cp</i>: and be equall unto
  them. And let <i>hz</i>, be drawne: This <i>hz</i> shall be cut one line,
  by the <a href="#14_e_vij">14 e vij</a>. For as the whole <i>tr</i>, that
  is <i>rf</i>, is unto the greater segment that is to <i>fh</i>: so
  <i>fh</i>, that is <i>zg</i>, is unto <i>gr</i>. And two paire of shankes
  <i>fh</i>, <i>gr</i>, <i>fc</i>, <i>gz</i>, by the <a href="#6_e_xxj">6 e
  xxj</a>, are alternely or crosse-wise parallell. Therefore their bases
  are continuall.</p>

  <p>Hitherto it hath beene prooved that the quinquangle made is an
  equilater and plaine: It remaineth that it bee prooved to be Equiangled.
  Let therefore the right lines <i>ep</i>, and <i>ec</i>, be drawne: I say
  that the angles, <i>pbe</i>, and <i>ezi</i>, are equall: Because they
  have by the construction, the bases of equall shankes equall, being to
  wit in value the quadruple of <i>le</i>. For the right line <i>lf</i>,
  cut proportionally, and increased with the greater segment <i>df</i>,
  that is <i>fc</i>, is cut also proportionally, by the <a
  href="#4_e_xiiij">4 e xiiij</a>, and by the <a href="#7_e_xiiij">7 e
  xiiij</a>, the whole line proportionally cut, and the lesser segment,
  that is <i>cp</i>, are of treble value to the greater <i>fl</i>, that is
  of the sayd <i>le</i>. Therefore <i>el</i>, and <i>lc</i>, that is
  <i>ec</i>, and <i>cp</i>, that is <i>ep</i>, is of quadruple power to
  <i>el</i>: And therefore by the <a href="#14_e_xij">14 e xij</a>, it is
  the double of it: And <i>ei</i>, it selfe in like manner, by the fabricke
  or construction, is the double of the same. Therefore the bases are
  equall. And after the same manner, by drawing the right lines <i>id</i>,
  and <i>ib</i>, the third angle <i>bpi</i>, shall be concluded to be equal
  to the angle <i>ezi</i>. Therefore by the <a href="#13_e_xiiij">13 e
  xiiij</a>, five angles are equall. <!-- Page 282 --><span

  <p>This is the fifth example of irrationality and incommensurability. The
  first was of the diagony and side of a quadrate or square. The second was
  of a line proportionally cut and his segments: The third is of the
  diameter of a Circle and the side of an inscribed quinquangle. The fourth
  was of the diagony and side of an icosahedrum. The fifth now is of the
  diagony and side of a dodecahedrum.</p>

  </div>
  <p>But from hence also doth arise the geodesy or m&#x101;ner of measuring
  of a dodecahedrum. For if the quadrate of the line subtending the angle
  of a quinquangle be trebled, the half of the treble shall be the side of
  the semidiagony of the dodecahedrum: Because by the <a
  href="#6_e_xxiiij">6 e xxiiij</a>, the diagony of the cube, that is of
  the dodecahedrum is of treble power to the side of the cube. But if the
  quadrate of the side of the decangle be taken out of the quadrate of the
  side of the quinquangle; The side of the remainder shall be the ray of
  the circle circumscribed about a quinquangle. Lastly if the quadrate of
  the ray, be taken of the quadrate of the half-diagony; the side of the
  remainder shall be the heighth of perpendicular. As if the side of the
  decangle be 7.3/5: The quadrate of that shall be 57.19/25: the treble of
  which is 173.7/25 whose side is about 13.107/131 for the side of the
  Dodecahedrum, therefore 6.119/131 the halfe shall be the semidiagony of
  the dodecahedrum. The ray of the <!-- Page 283 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page283"></a>[283]</span>Circle shall now thus
  be found. If the quadrate of the side of the decangle be taken out of the
  quadrate of the side of the sexangle; the side of the remainder, shall be
  the Ray of the Circle, by the <a href="#15_e_xviij">15</a> and <a
  href="#9_e_xviij">9 e xviij</a>. As here the side of the Quinquangle is
  4.2/3. The side of the Decangle 2.2/5: And the quadrates therefore are
  21.7/9, and 5.19/25. This subducted from that leaveth 16.4/225 whose side
  is 4.2/15 for the Ray of the Circle.</p>

  <p>The semidiagony and ray of the circle thus found, the altitude
  remaineth. Take out therefore the quadrate of the ray of the circle,
  16.4/225 out of the quadrate of the semidiagony 47.12458/17161, the side
  of the remainder 31.2714406/3861225 is for the altitude or heighth: whose
  1/3 is 5/3. The quinquangled base is almost 38. Which multiplied by 5/3
  doth make 63.1/3 for the solidity of one Pyramis; which multiplied by 12,
  doth make 760. for the soliditie of the whole <span class="correction"

  <p>This appeareth plainely out of the nature of a solid angle, by the

  comprehended. Of three angles of an ordinate triangle is the angle of a
  Tetrahedrum comprehended: Of foure, an Octahedrum: Of five, an
  Icosahedrum: Of sixe none can be comprehended: For sixe such like plaine
  angles, are equall to 12 thirds of one right angle, that is to foure
  right angles. But plaine angles making a solid angle, are lesser than
  foure right angles, by the <a href="#8_e_xxij">8 e xxij</a>. Of seven
  therefore, and of more it is, much lesse possible. Of three quadrate
  angles the angle of a cube is comprehended: Of 4. such angles none may be

  quinquangle, is made the angle of a Dodecahedrum. Of 4. none may possibly
  be made; For every such angle: For every one of them severally doe
  countervaile one right angle and 1/5 of the same, Therefore they would be
  foure, and three fifths. Of more therefore much lesse may it be possible.

  <p>The axeltree in the three first bodies is rationall unto the side, as

  <p>As here let the Axis <i>ae</i>; be the diameter of the circle
  <i>aue</i>, and <i>ai</i>, equall to the same axis, and perpendicular

  Therefore by the <a href="#14_e_xij">14 e, xij</a>, it is of quadruple

  the <a href="#9_e_xij">9 e xij</a>, <i>uo</i>, that is againe by the <a

  <i>oe</i>: Let therefore <i>os</i>, be cut off equall to it. Now as the
  halfe of <i>ao</i>, is of quintuple valew to the halfe of <i>yo</i>: so
  the double <i>ae</i>, is of quintuple power to the double <i>ys</i>.
  Therefore, by the <a href="#18_e_xxv">18 e xxv</a>. seeing that the
  diagony <i>ae</i>, is of quintuple power to <i>ys</i>; the said
  <i>ys</i>, shall be the side of the sexangle inscribed into a circle,

  <i>uy</i>, is equall to <i>ys</i>; because each of them is the double of
  <i>yo</i>. Wherefore <i>uy</i>, is the side of the sexangle. But
  <i>ay</i>, is the side of the Decangle: For it is equall to <i>se</i>:
  Because if from equall rayes <i>ao</i>, and <i>oe</i>, you take equall

  <p>The latter, <i>Euclide</i> doth demonstrate with a greater

  here be repeated, The sections of the axis first into a double reason in
  <i>s</i>: And the side of the sexangle <i>rl</i>: And the side of the

  the quadrate of <i>se</i>, to the quadrate of <i>ei</i>: And inversly or
  backward, as <i>ae</i>, is to <i>se</i>: so is the quadrate of <i>ie</i>,
  to the quadrate of <i>se</i>. But <i>ae</i>, is the triple of <i>se</i>.
  Therefore the quadrate of <i>ie</i>, is the triple of <i>se</i>. But the

  greater than the quadrate of <i>ie</i>: And the right line <i>as</i>, is
  greater than <i>ie</i>, and <i>al</i>, therefore is much greater. But
  <i>al</i>, is by the grant <!-- Page 290 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  the said <i>rl</i>, is greeter than <i>ye</i>: And even now it was shewed

  <p>The demonstration of this proposition hath much troubled the
  interpreters. The reason of a Cylinder unto a Cone, may more easily be
  assumed from the reason of a Prisme unto a Pyramis: For a Cylinder doth
  as much resemble a Prisme, as the Cone doth a Pyramis: Yea and within the
  same sides may a Prisme and a Cylinder, a Pyramis and a Cone be
  conteined: And if a Prisme and a Pyramis have a very multangled base, the
  Prisme and <span class="correction" title="text reads `Clinder'"
  >Cylinder</span>, as also the Pyramis and Cone, do seeme to be the same
  figure. Lastly within the same sides, as the Cones and Cylinders, so the
  Prisma and Pyramides, from their axeltrees and diameters may have the
  similitude of their bases. And with as great reason may the Geometer
  demand to have it granted him, That the Cylinder is the treble of a Cone:
  As it was demanded and granted him, That Cylinders and Cones are alike,
  whose axletees are proportionall to the diameters of their bases.</p>

  <p><a name="19_e_xxvij"></a> 19. <i>A plaine made of the diameter, and
  sixth part of the greater, or lesser sphearicall, is the greater or
  lesser sector.</i> <!-- Page 299 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page299"></a>[299]</span></p>

  </div>
  <p>As here of the Diameter 14, and of 73.1/3 and 4.2/3 (which is the one
  sixth part of the greater sphearicall) the plaine is 1026.2/3 for the
  solidity of the greater sectour, so of the same diameter 14, and 29.1/3
  which is the 1/6 part of 176, the lesser sphæricall, the plaine is
  410.2/3 for the solidity of the lesser sectour.</p>

  <p>And from hence lastly doth arise the solidity of the section, by
  addition and subduction.</p>

  <p><a name="20_e_xxvij"></a> 20. <i>If the greater sectour be increased
  with the internall cone, the whole shall be the greater section: If the
  lesser be diminished by it, the remaine shall be the lesser
  section</i>.</p>

  <p>As here the inner cone measured is 126.4/63. The greater sectour, by
  the former was 1026.2/3. And <span class="correction" title="text reads `126'"
  >1026</span>.2/3 + 126.4/63 doe make 1152.46/63.</p>

  <p>Againe the lesser sectour, by the next precedent, was 410.2/3: And
  here the inner cone is 126.4/63 And therefore 410.2/3 - 126.4/63 that is
  284.38/63 is the lesser section.</p>
